	<p>Local MP Theresa May joined Christian Aid to take part in a nationwide world record attempt to drum home the enduring issues of world poverty.</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;I have always been a firm supporter of the Make Poverty History campaign. It has already been tremendously successful in driving International Development up the political agenda. The campaign gave a voice to millions of people on issues such as debt relief, international trade and <span class="caps">HIV</span>/AIDs.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Now we are here to show that that voice is still speaking. 2005 brought the issues of International Development into the public consciousness. In 2006 we need to keep the momentum going and inspire further, and lasting, political action. Nearly 3 billion people, every day, go without basic things that the rest of believe we have a right to &acirc;&#128;&#147; decent food, clean water, shelter, healthcare and education. We need to do as much as we can to right these wrongs.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;It has been truly exhilarating to be part of this nationwide, world record breaking event. And it is made all the more poignant to know that our drumming may well resonate with the government and urge them to press the World Bank and International Monetary Foundation for reform.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May helps launch &acirc;&#128;&#152;Women in Rheumatoid Arthritis&acirc;&#128;&#153;</h1>


<p class="published"> 6 July 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>This week local MP Theresa May helped launch the <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Women in Rheumatoid Arthritis&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em> awareness campaign. <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Women in Rheumatoid Arthritis&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em> is a partnership initiative between the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (<span class="caps">NRAS</span>), Arthritis Care and the healthcare company, Abbott.  The initiative aims to raise awareness of the effects of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on people in the UK, through the stories of 10 women living with the condition as described in interviews with 10 female politicians for a new book launched on 5th July.</p>

	<p>Theresa May commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;As a patron of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, I am proud to contribute to raising awareness of the impact Rheumatoid Arthritis can have. Approximately up to 886 people in Maidenhead are likely to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis foo<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2275791314994aca0e9325">1</a></sup>. It is a condition that affects young and old alike with women three times more likely to be affected than men. It is essential that we increase awareness of the damaging impact the condition can have on sufferers.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The new book features 10 personal accounts of living with rheumatoid arthritis, such as Heidi. Heidi is a 17 year old who has been living with rheumatoid arthritis for just over a year. She has almost an 80% chance of being moderately or severely disabled before she reaches the age of 40. She wants to be a chef but her wrists are too weak to carry heavy kitchen utensils. Hers is just one of the unique and inspiring stories that was unveiled in Westminster this week&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The new initiative aims to highlight the challenges in diagnosing and managing this complex, chronic autoimmune disorder. More must be done to ensure that sufferers are able to receive the care and attention they deserve, and I look forward to working with the campaign to ensure that this is realised&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p id="fn2275791314994aca0e9325" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Based on 2001 National Census of&Acirc;&nbsp; Maidenhead population of 88,671. Incidence of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the UK is approximately 1% of the population</p>

<h1 class="article">May: new measures to promote local green energy are&nbsp;welcome</h1>


<p class="published">11 July 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May MP, Shadow Leader of the House, today welcomed proposals by the Government to make it easier for homes to install small-scale renewable energy, such as solar water heating or mini-wind turbines. The move by the Government to change planning rules comes after a Conservative campaign to push for more green energy and micro-generation.</p>

	<p>Also this week, David Cameron has made a major speech calling for:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A level playing field between renewable and other forms of energy generation.</li>
		<li>Encouraging local generators to sell any spare electricity they generate back to the National Grid.</li>
		<li>Improving and streamlining planning procedures for green energy.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>May explained,</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome that the Government has responded to cross-party pressure to make it easier for homes in Maidenhead and across the country to install renewable energy like solar panels or mini-wind turbines. Where the Government offers positive, constructive and reasonable policies, they will have my support.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;But the Government could do far more to promote green energy, rather than giving unfair subsidies to new nuclear power stations. Conservatives want to enhance our environment by seeking a long-term cross-party consensus on sustainable development and climate change &acirc;&#128;&#147; instead of short-term thinking or surrendering to vested interests. The modern, compassionate Conservative Party believes that quality of life matters just as much as quantity of money.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<div class="article-body">
	<p>MP donates children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s books to Maidenhead library</p>

	<p>Rt Hon Theresa May MP celebrated the success of children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s literature last week at a House of Commons reception held by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries and Information Management.</p>

	<p>The All Party Group heard how children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s book borrowing from public libraries is increasing thanks to the hard work of librarians and partner organisations, and schemes like the Summer Reading Challenge.  The Summer Reading Challenge is organised by The Reading Agency and takes a powerful new, and nationally co-ordinated approach, to inspiring children to read.</p>

	<p>Every year, more and more children take part in the Summer Reading Challenge, undertaken in partnership with public libraries and supported by children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s publishers.  This year an amazing 700,000 children are expected to take part across the UK.</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#153;To get more readers, reading more we need to harness the power of public libraries,&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em> said Rt Hon Theresa May MP.  <em>&acirc;&#128;&#153;What&acirc;&#128;&#153;s most exciting is that the range and quality of children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s books is better than ever, and working in partnership with publishers and booksellers, libraries can help expand the market.  They help children get the reading habit early, and make it possible for parents and carers to give children a huge variety of books.  I am pleased to support the Summer Reading Challenge, and happy to present Maidenhead Library with a donation of books courtesy of The Reading Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s publishing partners.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa calls for greater focus on hepatitis&nbsp;C</h1>


<p class="published">25 July 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Responding to the publication of an audit by the All-Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group which found that only 8% of Primary Care Trusts have taken effective action to improve hepatitis C services, Theresa May MP said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The Government published in 2004 an Action Plan to improve hepatitis C services but there seems to have been little but inaction since then from too many parts of the <span class="caps">NHS</span>. Hepatitis C is a public health time bomb and it needs addressing now. It is unacceptable that so many <span class="caps">PCT</span>s are ignoring the scale of the problem.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

	<p>The audit was conducted on behalf of the Group by the Hepatitis C Trust. With help and advice from a panel of healthcare professionals, The Hepatitis C Trust conducted the audit on the basis of 10 criteria, scoring <span class="caps">PCT</span>s out of 10 depending on whether or not they had fulfilled each of the criteria.</p>

	<p>A score between 8 and 10 indicated that a <span class="caps">PCT</span> has made a major effort and significant progress in implementing the Action Plan, whilst a score of 3 or less suggests the Plan is onlt being implemented minimally or not al all. A score of between 4 and 7 indicated that some progress has been made to implement the Plan, but that more needs to be done.</p>

	<p>An assessment of the audit response from <span class="caps">PCT</span>s in Maidenhead shows that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead primary Care Trust scores 6</li>
		<li>Wokingham Primary Care Trust scored 6</li>

<h1 class="article">May hits back as governmnet fails to address local&nbsp;train</h1>


<p class="published">18 July 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>The Government has refused to reply to specific concerns raised in writing by Theresa May MP regarding the rail service to Maidenhead and Twyford.</p>

	<p>Theresa May wrote in March to the Department for Transport calling for a full reinstatement of all fast and semi-fast services that had been removed from the First Great Western draft December 2006 timetable.</p>

	<p>The Department replied to Theresa on the 12th June. In response to their letter, Theresa May said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Instead of getting a full response from the Department, I received a standard letter, pointing me in the direction of two announcements <span class="caps">FGW</span> had made in April and June. I was eager to read these announcements to see if our concerns had been fully addressed by the department. Unfortunately I was severely disappointed. Although April&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement proudly heralded the reinstatement of one service from Twyford to London Paddington, the July announcement appeared to be nothing to do with Maidenhead at all &acirc;&#128;&#147; it detailed additional services on the South Coast!</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;This is just a further example of how the Government has lost touch with the citizens of Maidenhead &acirc;&#128;&#147; after all, they should at least know we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re not on the South Coast!</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Furthermore, the letter announces that, &acirc;&#128;&#152;many of the local services have been reinstated&acirc;&#128;&#153;. This is simply not true. One new train has been introduced and one has been reinstated.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;They consider that this improvement &acirc;&#128;&#152;successfully balances competing demands&acirc;&#128;&#153; for their service. This is again a falsehood. They will not satisfy the demands of the thousands of Maidenhead commuters until they reinstate all mainline fast and semi-fast services.&rsquo;</em></p>

<div class="article-body">
	<p>First Great Western have told local MP Theresa May that they have agreed to reinstate the 0727 from Twford to London Paddington.</p>

	<p>Richard Green at the First Group confirmed that the new 0726 was effectively a reinstatement of the 0727. He also admitted that this development was a direct result of the consultation period with local commuters and Theresa May.</p>

	<p>Theresa May said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;First Great Western have had to listen to the needs of the Tywford and Maidenhead commuter. We have fiercely campaigned for the reinstatement of the 0726 and this is a real win for the local community.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;However, there is still a long way to go; the campaign is by no means over. I will continue to press First Great western for the reinstatement of all fast and semi-fast services from Twyford and Maidenhead.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May supports new neighbourhood&nbsp;policing</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 September 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed a new policing approach that aims to provide all communities with their own dedicated neighbourhood policing team. These teams will identify and resolve local issues affecting people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sense of security. They will also help raise the accountability of the police force in the local area.</p>

	<p>The teams will forge closer links between the dedicated neighbourhood officers, their partners (including neighbourhood watch, local authorities and housing associations) and Police Community Support Officers.</p>

	<p>Theresa May said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;In order to police neighbourhoods effectively, police need to really understand the area and community and the issues that concern local people. In other words, the police need to be able to see through the neighbourhood&acirc;&#128;&#153;s eyes.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;I welcome the move my Thames Valley to integrate local communities and the police force in order to make neighbourhood policing more transparent, accountable and efficient. Neighbourhood teams will provide a local face to police actions and will provide informed, local answers and sustainable solutions to community problems.&rsquo;</em></p>

	<p>Following a lengthy consultation process Thames Valley Police have separated Windsor and Maidenhead have been split into 13 neighbourhoods and each neighbourhood will be subject to the roll-out of neighbourhood policing at some stage between now and 2008.</p>

	<p>The success of Neighbour teams rest largely on the number of Police Community Support Officers that Maidenhead can attract. Thames Valley Police have admitted that recruitment and retention of <span class="caps">PCSO</span>s in the Maidenhead area has been problematic. Of all the applications forms sent by Thames Valley Police to the Maidenhead are, only 10% return.</p>

	<p>May adds: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;I hope we can convince more people to join as <span class="caps">PCSO</span>s. I truly believe they can make a vital difference to local policing and are a valued and important part of the local community.  Some of the problems stem from the length and bureaucracy of the application forms. However, I hope people will be able to see past the problems with the form and help us build up strong neighbourhood teams in Maidenhead.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<p class="published">10 September 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Local MP Theresa May today welcomed the British Heart Foundation&acirc;&#128;&#153;s (<span class="caps">BHF</span>) Food4Thought campaign.</p>

	<p>The campaign is aimed at exposing the hidden salt, fat and sugar lurking in common foods, so children can better understand the potential damage it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s doing to their hearts and health.</p>

	<p>At the heart of Food4Thought is an advertising campaign depicting a young girl drinking from a bottle of cooking oil with the caption &acirc;&#128;&#152;What goes into crisps goes into you&acirc;&#128;&#153;. As part of the campaign, education packs, in the shape of giant burger boxes, containing resources to help children better understand what foods are good for their health, are being sent to classrooms around the UK.</p>

	<p>The problem of poor diet and nutrition among children is a key factor in rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>

	<p>A 2004 report revealed that only 13% of boys and 12% of girls across the UK reported eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, and 10% reported eating no portions of fruit or vegetables in the previous day .</p>

	<p>A new report for the <span class="caps">BHF</span> shows that half of 8 to 15-year-olds across the UK eat at least a bag of crisps a day and almost one in five eat crisps twice a day or more.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; And the case for practical cooking skills in schools is supported by the fact that 37% of UK youngsters aren&acirc;&#128;&#153;t confident peeling a vegetable .</p>

	<p>Supporting the BHF&acirc;&#128;&#153;s campaign, Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Fighting obesity is one of today&acirc;&#128;&#153;s key public health challenges. The work of organisations like the <span class="caps">BHF</span> is vital in ensuring that young people are equipped to make informed choices about healthy eating and living.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Local MP Theresa May encourages Maidenhead students to enter the Parliamentary Press Gallery writing competition 2006-07.</p>

	<p>Since 2003 the Parliamentary Press Galley has run a writing competition for students, designed to complement citizenship lessons in schools and aimed at pupils in years 10 to 13.</p>

	<p>The competition is divided into age groups and by region and each year a specific theme is chosen for each of them to write on &acirc;&#128;&#147; this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s theme is the environment.</p>

	<p>A winner from each region will be chosen and then a final judging panel including well-known MPs and journalists will decide upon an overall winner for this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s competition.</p>

	<p>All the regional winners will be invited in March 2007 to spend a day in Parliament where they will meet the Speaker and many other Members of Parliament, including the Prime Minister. They will also meet political journalists from the variety of national and regional newspapers, television and radio broadcasters, news agencies, news magazines, internet publishers and the specialist press represented in the Press Gallery.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The competition provides an exciting opportunity for young people interested in journalism or politics.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;It is wonderful to see events which promote amongst young people awareness and discussion of the values of parliamentary democracy and the political process.</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May congratulates Maidenhead nominee for prestigious national&nbsp;award</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 November 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May MP is delighted the Maidenhead based firm Nortel UK Ltd has been nominated for this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s BlackBerry Women &amp; Technology Awards. Nortel UK Ltd has been nominated in the category Best Company Advancing Women in Technology.</p>

	<p>The Awards, hosted annually, celebrate the achievements of women using technology both within and beyond the IT sector, bringing their outstanding contributions to business via the use of technology into the public eye.</p>

	<p>The Awards look to honour the individual (or company) that has achieved success and competitive advantage through innovation, management and return on investment via technology.</p>

	<p>The Awards evening will be held in London on Thursday 2 November.</p>

	<p>Theresa May said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;These awards make it clear that there is a wealth of female talent in the technology sector. However, it is still the case that about 70% of women with science and technology qualifications are not working within the profession.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Therefore it is important that the Government and the industry do more not only to ensure that women are attracted to the sector, but also that they are retained and given the means to progress.</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is wonderful to see a Maidenhead based UK firm leading the way in this area. I wish Nortel all the best for the awards and encourage them to keep up their good work for women in technology.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published"> 7 November 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Maidenhead MP Theresa May is calling on Michael Shanley to give local residents more time to comment on his plans to develop housing on Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;A lot of people told me they couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t get to the exhibition about Michael Shanley&acirc;&#128;&#153;s plans for Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit as it was only held for one day &acirc;&#128;&#147; and a week day at that! I am writing to Michael Shanley to make it clear to him that he cannot avoid the objections of local residents in this way. He must listen to local people. So I am calling on him to put the exhibition on again, for a longer period, ideally over a weekend, so many of the local residents who work during the week can see his plans and give him their views.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;What&acirc;&#128;&#153;s more I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m telling him that he mustn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t think that failure to attend the exhibition means people are happy with his plans. Far from it! Most people are aghast at the size of the development he is proposing which goes way beyond anything previously proposed.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;A development of 430 homes with 5 storey blocks of flats is simply unacceptable! It will bring the local roads to a standstill and put pressure on other services like schools and GPs&acirc;&#128;&#153; services.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have always felt strongly about the development of this site and I shall continue to campaign strongly on this issue with local residents. We need to ensure that we make the local voice heard.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;If you would like me to keep you informed about developments on this issue please contact me at House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA, on 0207 219 1304 or <a href="mailto:mayt@parliament.uk">mayt@parliament.uk</a>&lsquo;</em>.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa insists Shanly should listen to local&nbsp;people</h1>


<p class="published">28 November 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Developer Michael Shanly has rejected local MP Theresa May&acirc;&#128;&#153;s request for another exhibition for local residents on his plans for developing Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;I wrote to Michael Shanly on November 7th after a number of local residents told me that they couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t get to the exhibition about his plans for Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit because it was held only on one day and a weekday at that.&Acirc;&nbsp; That meant they couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t ask questions about his plans or give their views. I pressed him for a further exhibition to be held, over a weekend, to allow local people to make their views known.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;Now he&acirc;&#128;&#153;s replied ruling out any further exhibition period and saying I must have been &acirc;&#128;&#156;incorrectly briefed&acirc;&#128;&#157;.&Acirc;&nbsp; I wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t briefed by anyone on this. Unlike him I talk to local people and hear their views direct. &Acirc;&nbsp;I am appalled that he is refusing to take into account the wishes of many local residents who are concerned that his development will severely alter the area and their quality of life.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I can only assume that he doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want to give more people the chance to comment on his plans because he knows that his proposed development of 430 homes with 5 storey blocks of flats will be unacceptable to local residents. It will bring the local roads to a standstill and put pressure on other services like schools and GPs&acirc;&#128;&#153; services.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I only hope he doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t try to claim that there were so few people at the exhibition that his plans are supported. He is not fooling anyone, and the people of Maidenhead will not accept his refusal to consult them.&rsquo;</em></p>

	<p>If you will be affected by Michael Shanly&acirc;&#128;&#153;s proposed development of Badnells Pitt and would like further consultation on his proposals please feel free to contact me at The House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA, 0207 219 1304 or at <a href="mailto:mayt@parliament.uk">mayt@parliament.uk</a>.</p>

<p class="published"> 5 December 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>As the First Great Western (<span class="caps">FGW</span>) December 2006 timetable comes into force on December 10, Theresa May continues to press for a decent service to Maidenhead and Twyford.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The December 2006 timetable is simply not good enough for the large numbers of commuters that travel from Maidenhead and Twyford and on the branch lines every day. The 2,500 signature petition led to small improvements but nowhere near what was needed.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have met with <span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail again recently to discuss these issues and although they accepted that the timetable was not ideal none of them were willing to take the blame for the unacceptable provisions to Maidenhead and Twyford set out in the new timetable. I have also raised the issue in a meeting with the Transport minister.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;But as if coping with the December 2006 timetable wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t bad enough. Now we are being told that we need to comment now on the timetable for December 2007. <span class="caps">FGW</span> tell me that, due to the large number of complaints they received for the December 2006 timetable, they will not be holding a long consultation period for December 2007.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;This is simply unacceptable. They seem to think that if they don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t let people comment on the timetable they can claim there is no opposition to the proposals.&Acirc;&nbsp;</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have been informed that any comments submitted after 18 January 2007 will be unlikely to be considered. So please let <span class="caps">FGW</span> know your views <span class="caps">NOW</span>! And please do copy me into all your correspondence with them on this issue.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I shall be pushing for a full reinstatement of all semi-fast and fast services which were lost in the December 2006 timetable. I shall also be pressing for further improvements to the Maidenhead and Twyford services following the investments by <span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail over the next few years and for better branch line connections.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;<span class="caps">FGW</span> will be spending &Acirc;&pound;150million by the end of 2007 on refurbishment and replacement of their rolling stock and Network Rail are spending &Acirc;&pound;750million over 2-3 years on their tracks and infrastructure. Maidenhead and Twyford must be able to see the benefit of this expenditure.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;If you would like to comment to <span class="caps">FGW</span> in person, Richard Rowland, General Manager for the Thames Valley area, will be at Maidenhead station on the evening of Monday 11th January between 4-7pm, Twyford on Tuesday 12th between 4-7pm and London Paddington on the 14th between 4-7pm.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;Alternatively on Monday 11th December I shall be at Maidenhead and Twyford stations during the early morning peak &acirc;&#128;&#147; I shall be happy to speak with any of you about the new service and discuss improvements we can insist on for the future.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May raises trains and third Thames Bridge in meeting with transport&nbsp;minister</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 December 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Today Theresa May joined a delegation of Thames Valley MPs and local businesses to press the Transport Minister for better transport infrastructure in the Thames Valley area.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Today at a meeting with Transport Minster Gillian Merron I pressed the Government to improve our train service and for the need for a third Thames Bridge to relieve Sonning Bridge.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;The meeting was a joint meeting of a cross-party group of Thames Valley MPs and businesses who are members of the Thames Valley Economic Partnership with the Minister to press for Government action to improve transport links in our area. <span class="caps">TVEP</span> members include key multi-nationals like 3, Microsoft, Prudential, Vodaphone, Dell, Cisco, Oracle and Siemens.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;The message was clear. Without better transport infrastructure business will no longer want to locate in the Thames Valley. That means we would lose jobs and economic activity in Maidenhead and the local area, but it would also mean a loss for the UK.&Acirc;&nbsp; Multi-national businesses locate in our area because of good transport links and many believe we are reaching a tipping point where failure to act by the Government will mean businesses will move out. &Acirc;&nbsp;For example, <span class="caps">TVEP</span> has calculated that business spends over &Acirc;&pound;8million a year in the cost of taxis to Heathrow because there are no direct rail links from our area to Heathrow. If just six corporates left the Thames Valley it could mean the loss of 23,500 jobs and over &Acirc;&pound;1 billion of economic activity.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I raised the impact of the slow deterioration in our train service, the need to improve the Great Western mainline and capacity at Reading station and the need to get trains to Maidenhead back on the mainline.&Acirc;&nbsp; I also told the Minister that if Crossrail stops at Maidenhead it will mean a worse service for local people.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I also emphasised the need for a third bridge over the Thames to relieve Sonning Bridge and improve access north to south in the Thames Valley.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I want to see Government action on these issues. and I shall continue to press them for better transport infrastructure for Maidenhead and the wider Thames Valley.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May witnesses new train timetable chaos at first&nbsp;hand</h1>


<p class="published">12 December 2006</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>On Monday morning Theresa May joined commuters in Maidenhead and Twyford to experience first hand FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s new December 2006 timetable.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The first days of the new timetable were an unmitigated disaster. Peak hour trains were late, overcrowded and some were even cancelled. &Acirc;&nbsp;Passengers were left standing on platforms as others tried desperately to squeeze onto the few fast trains left in the timetable.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have told <span class="caps">FGW</span> for months that their continual cuts to services for Maidenhead and Twyford would only lead to further problems. Now my fears have been confirmed and the service only gets worse and worse.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;On Monday morning I saw trains arriving at Twyford and Maidenhead in the morning peak which were already almost full to capacity. It was bad enough at Twyford &acirc;&#128;&#147; a few people were able to squeeze in &ndash; but impossible at Maidenhead.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;It is appalling for <span class="caps">FGW</span> to allow passengers to be packed in like sardines on services which then run slow, despite being labelled a &ldquo;fast service.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s level of service is simply unacceptable. Now they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve given us just five weeks to tell them what we think before they put together the timetable for December 2007. I will continue my campaign to improve services and I urge anyone with a complaint about the trains to contact <span class="caps">FGW</span> at <a href="mailto:fgwfeedback@firstgroup.com">fgwfeedback@firstgroup.com</a>, copying me in at <a href="mailto:mayt@parliament.uk">mayt@parliament.uk</a> .</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;Fewer services, more crowding, delayed services and angry commuters &acirc;&#128;&#147; FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s new timetable has not got off to a good start.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May calls on FGW to lose&nbsp;franchise</h1>


<p class="published">15 January 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Local MP Theresa May has called for <span class="caps">FGW</span> to lose its franchise to provide train services to Maidenhead, Twyford and the branch lines. Theresa has also secured a debate in Parliament on Thursday 18 January on the problems with local train services.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The December 2006 timetable has been a disaster. I continue to get emails every day from passengers complaining about overcrowding, delays and cancellations. The recent changes to the timetable have done little to help. We will only get a decent service back when we have a train operator committed to commuter services and a Government that is interested in passengers&acirc;&#128;&#153; needs not its own targets.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I will be raising these issues in Parliament on 18 January in a short debate which I have called on train services for Maidenhead and Twyford.&Acirc;&nbsp; I didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t get satisfactory answers from <span class="caps">FGW</span> now let&acirc;&#128;&#153;s see what the Minister has to say. &Acirc;&nbsp;Government must take their share of the blame as the specification they set for the timetable was inadequate.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;But whatever they say I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m now at the point where I believe we need a different company serving Maidenhead and Twyford and the branch lines, and that <span class="caps">FGW</span> should lose this part of the franchise.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have joined with other Thames Valley MPs to call for a meeting with the Secretary of State, <span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail &acirc;&#128;&#147; with all three present they will no longer be able to simply point the finger of blame and avoid taking any action. &Acirc;&nbsp;And we are also asking the <span class="caps">HSE</span> to look again into the problem of overcrowding on trains. It is remarkable that there are laws protecting chickens from overcrowding but nothing to protect human commuters!</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;My constituents have suffered poor train services for too long under <span class="caps">FGW</span>. Its time for the Government to act.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May slams FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s failure to listen to local&nbsp;passengers</h1>


<p class="published">10 January 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May MP has attacked <span class="caps">FGW</span> for its failure to listen to local passengers&acirc;&#128;&#153; complaints following revelations that <span class="caps">FGW</span> have improved services from Oxford and ignored the needs of passengers from Maidenhead and Twyford.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;I was appalled when I saw the latest timetable changes from <span class="caps">FGW</span> which are due to come in next Monday 15 January.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;They claim they have listened to passengers&acirc;&#128;&#153; complaints but in fact they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve completely ignored people travelling from Maidenhead and Twyford. &Acirc;&nbsp;For us the service will get worse. The 0726 which currently starts, empty, at Twyford will now start at Oxford. There are few enough seats at Maidenhead on this already.&Acirc;&nbsp; What on earth will it be like when it starts from Oxford?</em></p>

	<p>_&rsquo;What is galling is that this was the train added to the timetable following our campaign last year. Only two days ago they were boasting that this was a &acirc;&#128;&#156;significant investment in Twyford and Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#157;. Now they&acirc;&#128;&#153;re undoing all that.</p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I am deeply disappointed that <span class="caps">FGW</span> have chosen to ignore the concerns of Maidenhead and Twyford commuters. &Acirc;&nbsp;I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve had nearly 600 emails complaining about the new timetable since it started.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;<span class="caps">FGW</span> clearly have no interest in providing a decent service to their customers.&Acirc;&nbsp; I am meeting with Alison Forster, the Managing Director of <span class="caps">FGW</span>, &Acirc;&nbsp;tomorrow and I have insisted that she bring to our meeting proposals for real improvements to the service for Maidenhead and Twyford as these current changes are simply unacceptable.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<p class="published"> 7 January 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Local MP Theresa May has attacked <span class="caps">FGW</span> for offering new livery on the trains rather than a better service.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&lsquo;I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m astounded. Just when commuters are being forced to endure fewer trains, cancellations, late running and awful overcrowding, <span class="caps">FGW</span> are spending money and time on cosmetic enhancements to their fleet.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;What we want is a decent service, not pretty trains. New paint won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t make the trains go faster.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I am afraid that this is just another example of <span class="caps">FGW</span> missing the point. I will leave <span class="caps">FGW</span> in no doubt that it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s the timetable that needs a make-over not the trains.&rsquo;</em><br>
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br>
Theresa will be attending a meeting with Alison Forster, Managing Director of <span class="caps">FGW</span>, and other Thames Valley MPs later this week. However, Theresa was adamant that she should have a private meeting with Ms Forster specifically to discuss the needs of Maidenhead and Twyford and the branch lines.</p>

	<p>As Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;It is clear that the December 2006 timetable severely sidelines the needs of the Thames Valley in favour of longer distance journeys, and therefore I am glad to meet with Alison Forster and other Thames Valley MPs to discuss possible improvements.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;But there are specific problems for my constituents travelling from Maidenhead and Twyford and the branch line stations of Wargrave, Cookham and Furze Platt. I think it is vital that I meet with Alison Forster on my own to press home the need for significant improvements. That way I can make sure she knows about all the complaints raised by passengers in the over 500 emails I have received. This train timetable is affecting people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s lives and <span class="caps">FGW</span> must act now to improve it.&rsquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">May: FGW the ball is in your&nbsp;court</h1>


<p class="published">19 January 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May MP held a debate on the state of the train service for Maidenhead and Twyford in the House of Commons on 18 January. During the debate the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Tom Harris MP, admitted that <span class="caps">FGW</span> must listen to their passengers and add more services to the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s minimum level specification.</p>

	<p>Theresa explains, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The debate meant I could tell the Minister face to face how bad our trains are and explain the problems for local people.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;The Minister was quite clear that <span class="caps">FGW</span> are delivering performance &acirc;&#128;&#156;below the national level&acirc;&#128;&#157;.&Acirc;&nbsp; He also made it clear that the service specification set by the Government is a minimum and that <span class="caps">FGW</span> should add value to these specifications after listening to the needs of their customers.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;That flies in the face of claims by <span class="caps">FGW</span> that they are simply having to deliver the service specification given by Government.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;The Minister&acirc;&#128;&#153;s statement that he looks &acirc;&#128;&#156;to First Great Western, to listen to its passengers and stakeholders and to make changes to meet their needs&acirc;&#128;&#157; gives a pretty clear message to <span class="caps">FGW</span> &acirc;&#128;&#147; do something about the problem!</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;The ball is now in FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s court.&Acirc;&nbsp; Despite saying there were no carriages available to improve services they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve miraculously found some for the Bristol area so they&acirc;&#128;&#153;d better find some more for Maidenhead and Twyford services and give us the trains people need.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;We don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want excuses and we don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t want changes that make life better somewhere else down the line but don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t help Maidenhead and Twyford.&Acirc;&nbsp; We want action to make life better for local passengers.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">31 January 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>After two debates in the House of Commons on <span class="caps">FGW</span> and their poor service to their customers, Theresa May MP is calling for them to step up to the plate and finally take some action.</p>

	<p>Theresa explains, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;In my debate on FGW&Acirc;&nbsp;the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Tom Harris, made it clear that the Government agrees that <span class="caps">FGW</span> have provided an &acirc;&#128;&#152;unacceptable level of service&acirc;&#128;&#153; to their customers.  He also clarified that, despite claims to the contrary, the Government expect <span class="caps">FGW</span> to add to their base service level commitment in order to provide an adequate service. He made it clear that the Government expect <span class="caps">FGW</span> to listen to their customers and respond to their needs. The Government expect <span class="caps">FGW</span> to accept culpability for what Tom Harris term their &acirc;&#128;&#152;disastrous performance&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I know they have been continuously notified of customer dissatisfaction since the new timetable was introduced.

	<p><em>&lsquo;I have put these points to Alison Forster, <span class="caps">FGW</span>&rsquo;s&Acirc;&nbsp;Managing Director, but am writing again to set out the many complaints I have received and urge them to do something to improve the daily commute for my constituents.</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Government u-turn on&nbsp;trains!</h1>


<p class="published">12 February 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>The Department of Transport have finally agreed to meet with local MP Theresa May and others to discuss FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s appalling service.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Early in January I and several other Thames Valley MPs wrote to Douglas Alexander, Secretary of State for Transport requesting a meeting regarding <span class="caps">FGW</span>.&Acirc;&nbsp; On Thursday last week I received a letter from Tom Harris, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, flatly refusing this meeting.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;He distanced himself and the Department from FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s failures and assured me that, as they were &acirc;&#128;&#152;monitoring&acirc;&#128;&#153; FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s performance, there was no need for a meeting.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I was obviously quite annoyed and was about to take this up with the Department for Transport when Douglas Alexander himself emailed me to apologise for Mr Harris&acirc;&#128;&#153; response and to confirm that a meeting would be possible in the next few weeks.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I am delighted that the Department have finally agreed to this meeting. And I will press to ensure that both Network Rail and <span class="caps">FGW</span> are represented in order to avoid any &acirc;&#128;&#152;buck-passing&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I welcome this Government u-turn. I hope it means they have realised that commuters from the Thames Valley are simply fed up with <span class="caps">FGW</span> appalling service and will no longer put up with the disinterest showed by the Government, Network Rail and <span class="caps">FGW</span> themselves.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;I will certainly use this meeting to impress upon them that people can no longer tolerate this appalling service from <span class="caps">FGW</span>. Something has to be done, and it is up to the Government, Network Rail and <span class="caps">FGW</span> to work together to make this happen.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa may encourages young people to show they're 'here to help'</h1>


<p class="published">20 February 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Today Theresa May&Acirc;&nbsp;encouraged young people in Maidenhead to apply for a Save the children &acirc;&#128;&#152;Here to HELP&acirc;&#128;&#153; award, funded by British Gas. Many awards of up to &Acirc;&pound;1000 and a few of up to &Acirc;&pound;3000 are available for projects which improve something in the local community.</p>

	<p>The awards are to help young people get involved in dynamic and lasting community projects. The awards have been running for nearly two years and have had a positive impact on the lives of over 10,000 children in England, Scotland and Wales.  Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;This is a great opportunity to improve our local area. So if you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re a young person who can think of a good project for your local area you should apply for an award.</em></p>

	<p><em>&lsquo;Save the Children will be offering &Acirc;&pound;1000 awards from projects that deal with health, education and the protection of children. And &Acirc;&pound;3000 awards for projects that specifically aim to benefit the most marginalised in society, such as poor children who have less chance of living in adequate housing and getting basic services like healthcare and education.&Acirc;&nbsp; I am sure that many young people in Maidenhead will be able to come up with wonderful proposals for these awards. Do keep me informed of your applications and their successes!&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Post Office closures: is yours next? Make your voice&nbsp;heard</h1>


<p class="published">27 February 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Local MP Theresa May is urging people to register their fears about post office closures before the consultation period ends on 8 March.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Government plan to close 2,500 post offices across the country. But so far they haven&acirc;&#128;&#153;t said where the closures will be.&Acirc;&nbsp; This leaves a threat hanging over all our post offices.</em></p>

	<p><em>Post offices are an important part of the life of our community. We have already seen post offices closed locally, for example in Sonning, Ross Road on the Larchfield Estate in Maidenhead and Woodlands Park. We have even seen threats in the past to close the main post office in Maidenhead town centre. Will your post office be next?</em></p>

	<p><em>I urge everyone to make their voice heard by telling the Government what they think about the proposed closures. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m sure the Government thinks that by not telling anyone which sites might close they won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have any complaints. Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t let them get away with a sham consultation. Make your voice heard. You can email your views to dti.enquiries@dti.gsi.gov.uk or write to Post Office Network Consultation, <span class="caps">DTI</span>, Response Centre 1, Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET. You have only got until 8 March or it will be too late.</em></p>

	<p>_I welcome the moves by Wokingham District Council to encourage more people to write to the Government to oppose post office closures and hope many people will do so. The Government have made a big fuss recently of welcoming public involvement in their actions, for example through the No 10 e-petitions site. As we saw with the road pricing petition, we can push post office closures up the Government agenda if a significant number of people register their views.<br>
We may not be able to force the Government to abandon their plans entirely. But we can make it clear that we will not accept any further post office closures locally._</p>

<h1 class="article">Finally some good news on the&nbsp;trains</h1>


<p class="published">28 February 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Yesterday Theresa May and other Thames Valley MPs met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Douglas Alexander, to discuss FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s appalling service to Maidenhead and Twyford, and press for Government action.</p>

	<p>Theresa explained, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve made clear to the Government that the train service is not good enough and have pressed for improvements. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m pleased to say the campaign has had some success.</em></p>

	<p><em>There is now a 40 point recovery plan agreed by <span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail following the Secretary of State&acirc;&#128;&#153;s meetings with them.&Acirc;&nbsp; This should improve the running of the trains and mean fewer delays.</em></p>

	<p><em>I shall be meeting with them in the near future to discuss this plan and see exactly how it will deliver better services to Maidenhead and Twyford and the branch lines.</em></p>

	<p><em>There will also be a new timetable in May 2007. It is a great victory for all <span class="caps">FGW</span> passengers that <span class="caps">FGW</span> have finally accepted the failure of the December 2006 timetable. &Acirc;&nbsp;I understand that services will be added and capacity increased across the network. But until we see the detail we won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know how far it will go in meeting passengers&acirc;&#128;&#153; complaints. Rest assured I will keep up the pressure for more fast and semi-fast services and increased capacity for Maidenhead and Twyford.</em></p>

	<p><em>The Secretary of State also made clear that if any train operating company were to show that it could not maintain its franchise requirements he would have no hesitation in using the powers available to him.</em></p>

	<p><em>This is a small but significant victory. Action is being taken. Now we need to see that turned into real improvements in services. I will be working to ensure that the recovery plan and new timetable make a difference for Maidenhead and Twyford, and if not, I shall be returning to the Secretary of State for further action.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">30 October 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May&Acirc;&nbsp;MP&Acirc;&nbsp;is celebrating the work the Warm Front scheme has done in Maidenhead&Acirc;&nbsp;to help the most vulnerable in the community to keep warm and stay healthy.</p>

	<p>Warm Front, which combats fuel poverty by installing central heating and heat saving insulation work into the homes of vulnerable people, has so far assisted 497 households in Maidenhead &ndash; a total spend of &Acirc;&pound;446,424.31 in the area.</p>

	<p>Theresa says, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Warm Front scheme provides heating and insulation to the homes of some of my most vulnerable constituents, and it has my total support. Affordable heat is a basic need that all should be able to benefit from, as a warm home is a healthy, happy home.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>In Maidenhead Warm Front grants have helped 56 households with children under the age of four, 114 households on <span class="caps">DLA</span>, and 309 households over the age of 60.</p>

	<p>Householders applying for the Warm Front scheme also have the opportunity to undergo a comprehensive check to see if they are in receipt of all the benefits they are entitled to. Benefit Entitlement Checks (<span class="caps">BEC</span>) have been operating as part of Warm Front since June 2003, with the average weekly increase per client in Maidenhead being found as &Acirc;&pound;21.79.</p>

	<p>To qualify, householders need to own their own home or rent from a private landlord, and they also need to be in receipt of an income or disability related benefit. Local residents can contact the Warm Front team on 0800 316 6014 to apply for a grant.</p>

	<p>Theresa May MP backed efforts to raise awareness of rheumatoid arthritis at a highly successful drop-in event recently held by local charity National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (<span class="caps">NRAS</span>) at the House of Commons.</p>

	<p>Speaking at the event organised, Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;The small things in life really do matter, but for people with rheumatoid arthritis, even the most mundane of activities can be turned into Everyday Everests. It is important that we use the opportunity of World Arthritis Day to gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by the half million people in the UK with this disease.&rsquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Having met with patients, charities and clinicians, I am more convinced than ever that we must take action to help people with rheumatoid arthritis.

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses new train chief for more&nbsp;improvements</h1>


<p class="published">12 November 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May recently met the new Managing Director of First Great Western Andrew Haines to discuss the current problems with the train service from Paddington to Maidenhead and Twyford and the impact of the new December timetable.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the extra fast services and increased capacity in the new timetable which comes into force on 9 December but I wanted to make sure that the new <span class="caps">FGW</span> boss was in no doubt that there is still more to be done to meet the needs of local commuters.</em></p>

	<p><em>In my meeting I raised the appalling level of overcrowding on recent services, particularly in the morning, and the recent poor reliability with late running and cancelled services.</em></p>

	<p><em>Andrew Haines recognised the recent problems and apologised to all local commuters for this disappointing service. Part of the problems have been due to work on the line by Network Rail, but <span class="caps">FGW</span>&rsquo;s resources have also been stretched by the need to train staff to operate the new <span class="caps">HST</span> trains which will be brought in as part of the December timetable. When the December timetable comes into force, train capacity will have been increased by 77% with the addition of 2320 seats in the morning and 512 in the evening. So the short term pain should lead to long term gain.</em></p>

	<p><em>I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that the transport minister Tom Harris MP, has called <span class="caps">FGW</span> in to keep up the pressure for action. He tells me that he was impressed by <span class="caps">FGW</span>&rsquo;s renewed focus on delivering a service to customers, but has pledged to &acirc;&#128;&#152;keep a close interest in performance on the route to ensure that <span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail live up to these promises&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em>.</p>

	<p><em>I&rsquo;ve asked <span class="caps">FGW</span> to do more to improve the evening services and to look at filling the gap in morning services from Maidenhead. After 19.30 there is not a single fast running service from Paddington. <span class="caps">FGW</span> need to understand that people work later and its concept of peak time needs to be extended until at least 20.00. In the December 2004 timetable there was a fast service at 19.44&acirc;&#128;&#153;</em>.</p>

	<p>_Sadly these issues may not be resolved until the new timetable for December 2008, but I will keep pressing <span class="caps">FGW</span> on these matters. <span class="caps">FGW</span> make initial bids for the December 2008 timetable in January. Thus there is an exceptionally short period of time in which commuters can react to this years&rsquo; new timetable. So please make sure you let <span class="caps">FGW</span> and me know what you think of the new services before Christmas.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is the best chance we have of achieving even more improvements._&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p><em>I would like to thank all the local commuters who have been in touch with me about their experiences with FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s service. It is only possible to make a real difference to the service if I hear first hand from commuters about the service.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Theresa May MP recently lent her support to the Wokingham Fair Trade Campaign (<span class="caps">WFTC</span>) by attending their information stand at the Twyford branch of Waitrose.

	<p>Following the visit, Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I believe that paying producers fairly for the goods we buy is very important, and looking for the Fairtrade mark on produce from the developing world is a good way to be sure we are doing that.

<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May MP has congratulated primary schools in the Maidenhead constituency following the publication of the 2007 Key Stage 2 Achievement and Attainment Tables.</p>

	<p>The data shows that of the 25 local schools that reported results, 19 scored above the national average for England for Key Stage 2. Maidenhead constituency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s average point score was also higher than the English national average. The results also included a Contextual Value Added measure which showed the progress made by pupils from the end of Key Stage 1 to the end of Key Stage 2.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I warmly congratulate all the primary schools that have achieved successful Key Stage 2 results. It is greatly encouraging to see that results in the Maidenhead constituency are above the national average for England.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I particularly congratulate Cookham Dean Church of England Primary School which recorded the highest average point score in the area, and White Waltham Church of England School which achieved the highest Contextual Added Value score.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;However, there is still much more that needs to be done to ensure good education for all our children. Britain has fallen in international rankings for literacy and numeracy and the Government has admitted that it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s failed to meet its targets for 11 year olds. We must give teachers more powers to restore order in schools and get back to tried and tested reading methods &acirc;&#128;&#147; and if we do this I am sure that we can see even better results in Maidenhead and the local area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>As local MP, Theresa May is determined that commuters should have their say. So tell <span class="caps">FGW</span> what you think, and tell Theresa too, before January so she can work on your behalf to achieve the train service that you want.</p>

	<p>The campaign so far has achieved real improvements to the train service. Please help Theresa continue to keep the pressure on <span class="caps">FGW</span>.</p>

<h1 class="article">Good news on Sandford&nbsp;farm</h1>


<p class="published">12 December 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the decision made by Wokingham Borough Council to turn down plans to build a combined residential and business complex on the Sandford Farm landfill site.</p>

	<p>The proposal, which had included plans for 150 new retirement homes, followed a number of proposals for the site that were rejected by Wokingham Borough Council. Local residents in Woodley had expressed concern about the loss of amenity and poor provisions for parking at the development. Residents in Charvil were worried about increased traffic through local roads.&Acirc;&nbsp;The construction of the development would also have dramatically increased the traffic levels in the local area, causing further disruption to residents.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&ldquo;I am pleased that Wokingham Council has listened to what local people want and has rejected this latest plan for Sandford Farm. The area is a valuable green space enjoyed by local residents and wildlife and I will continue to campaign on their behalf for it to stay that way.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Guarantee on&nbsp;Crossrail</h1>


<p class="published">18 December 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has obtained significant guarantees from the Government about the impact of Crossrail on Maidenhead and Twyford. Speaking in the House of Commons, Theresa argued that the Crossrail line should be extended to Reading saying that <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;if the Crossrail line does not extend from Maidenhead to Reading they (constituents in Twyford) would really lose out&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. She asked Transport Minister Tom Harris to guarantee that the line could be extended to Reading under existing legislation, meaning that the extension could be done more quickly. In response, the Minister stated that <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;the Government are committed to making a decision on the safeguarding of the route from Maidenhead to Reading for future possible extension of Crossrail to Reading&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. Importantly, he confirmed that the line could be extended under existing legislation and it would not have to go through the same lengthy parliamentary procedures as this Bill.</p>

	<p>Theresa also raised the problem of the impact of Crossrail on commuters in Maidenhead saying <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am concerned that my constituents in Maidenhead and Twyford could find themselves with a greatly reduced service and amenity when Crossrail is introduced, because they might lose First Great Western services and end up at the end of a metro line, which would be a slow stopping service that would take twice as long to get to Paddington as it does at the moment&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>.</p>

	<p>The Minister gave a commitment that <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;whenever the First Great Western franchise is renewed, we will ensure that due attention is paid to the points that she has raised about the level of Crossrail services at Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. Commenting on the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s guarantee, Theresa said <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;extending the Crossrail line to Reading would make rail travel for people in both Twyford and Maidenhead so much easier. I am pleased that we now have confirmation that the extension could be done under existing legislation which would make the process much quicker.&Acirc;&nbsp;I am also pleased that the need to give proper thought to services to Maidenhead has been accepted by the Government&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>.</p>

<h1 class="article">Campainging for broadband in Waltham St&nbsp;Lawrence</h1>


<p class="published">24 December 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has launched a campaign in Parliament to bring broadband to Waltham St Lawrence.&Acirc;&nbsp;Households in the village are in the 0.2 per cent of households in the country who still can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t receive broadband internet.&Acirc;&nbsp;Residents have long campaigned for the service to be extended to them and others in rural areas without broadband.</p>

	<p>Theresa May has taken on the cause and has launched a campaign to get the Government and Ofcom to work with broadband suppliers to improve access to broadband and telecommunication services in rural areas.&Acirc;&nbsp;She has tabled an Early Day Motion, a formal petition for a parliamentary debate, and is working with organisations such as the Community Broadband Network to raise the profile of this important issue.</p>

	<p>Theresa says, <em>&ldquo;For those who live in remote areas, or indeed those who run small businesses based in the countryside, quick and reliable telecommunications services are an increasingly important means of conducting day-to-day life.&Acirc;&nbsp;Yet, broadband access is still a problem for many rural communities across the country and rural consumers are, therefore, disadvantaged in this respect.&Acirc;&nbsp;I strongly believe that it is vital for rural areas to have an equal level of service to those in urban areas.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;I sympathise greatly with the frustration experienced by the residents of Waltham St Lawrence at being in the 0.2 per cent of households unable to receive broadband internet.&Acirc;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that we can bring about a speedy resolution to this problem.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Bevin boys&nbsp;badge</h1>


<p class="published">24 December 2007</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is looking for surviving Bevin Boys in the area to come forward to claim a unique veterans badge as a tribute to their sacrifices during and after the Second World War.</p>

	<p>The Bevin Boys scheme was introduced in 1943 by the Minister for Labour and National Service, Ernest Bevin, in response to an increasing shortage of labour in the coal mining industry. The scheme ran between 1943 and 1948 and involved recruiting men aged between 18 and 25 years to work in coal mines rather than in the armed forces. Some 48,000 men were either selected or volunteered under the scheme.</p>

	<p>Theresa says, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is important that we never forget the sacrifices that were made both at home and abroad during the war. The Government have decided that to mark the valuable contribution of the Bevin Boys by awarding them with a special badge. If you are a Bevin Boy living in Maidenhead, or you know someone who is, please come forward to claim this fitting tribute&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>The first badges will be issued in March next year, to coincide with the 60th anniversary to the demobbing of the last Bevin Boy.&Acirc;&nbsp;All Bevin Boys, whether they are ballotees, optants or volunteers are able to apply.&Acirc;&nbsp;Applications will also be accepted from the widows of Bevin Boys who passed away on or after 20 June 2007 provided a copy of the marriage and death certificate are attached to the application form.&Acirc;&nbsp;Applicants must complete an application form, available by calling the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency helpline on 0800 169 2277 or 01253 866043, or by visiting <a href="http://www.veteransagency.co.uk/">www.veteransagency.co.uk</a></p>

<p class="published">15 January 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>In response to an issue raised by constituents, Theresa May has written to the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform to express concern about the extent of nuisance unsolicited telephone calls received by Maidenhead residents.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;This is an issue which has been raised by Maidenhead residents and I think the Government needs to look closely at it. We all know what a nuisance these calls are but it can also cause great distress to be targeted by recorded messages. I am aware of one case where these unwanted calls have targeted an elderly lady living alone who was distressed by the calls. These are completely unacceptable tactics.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I hope the Government will take very seriously the concerns that have been voiced by local residents.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<h3>Text of the letter Theresa May sent to John Hutton, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform:</h3>

	<p>Rt Hon John Hutton MP<br>
Secretary of State<br>
Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform<br>
1 Victoria Street<br>
London<br>
SW1H 0ET</p>

	<p>15th January 2008</p>

	<p>Dear Secretary of State,</p>

	<p>Several of my constituents have contacted me recently with concerns about the number of unsolicited nuisance telephone calls that they are receiving. These phone calls &acirc;&#128;&#147; which are often automated &acirc;&#128;&#147; invariably attempt to sell them a product, or convince the person that they have won a competition that they did not enter. In one case the calls targeted an elderly lady living alone, who was distressed by the calls.</p>

	<p>I am sure that you would agree that these tactics are unscrupulous. As you will be aware, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 require that marketers who leave recorded phone messages must obtain the prior consent of the subscriber before they can make that call. It is clear that this is not happening in many cases.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately many people are unaware of the Telephone Preference Service, which offers protection against unsolicited calls.</p>

	<p>I am writing to ask what the Government is planning to do to address this issue, which can cause great distress to many people. I would also be grateful if you could inform me of what measures the Government has taken to increase awareness of the means that already exist by which people can take action to prevent unwanted calls.</p>

	<p>Thank you in advance for your response on this matter. Given the inherent public interest in this issue, I am releasing a copy of this letter to the media.</p>

	<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

	<p>Rt Hon Theresa May MP</p>

	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the move by First Great Western (<span class="caps">FGW</span>) boss Andrew Haines to give regular commuters double compensation following the appalling train service that they have endured over the last year.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;After the appalling service local commuters have had to put up with over the past year, it is about time they got something back from <span class="caps">FGW</span>.

<h1 class="article">Post Office&nbsp;closures</h1>


<p class="published">29 January 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has pledged to fight plans to shut six post offices in the Maidenhead constituency.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am astounded at this announcement by the Post Office. It is a real kick in the teeth to all those people who rely on their local post office. What&acirc;&#128;&#153;s more, Maidenhead is set to suffer more than many surrounding areas with four closures in the town and another two in the rest of the constituency. What have they got against Maidenhead? Over the years I have fought successfully against Post Office closures and will fight hard against these latest plans. A local Post Office can be a lifeline for many elderly people. Doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t the Post Office understand that? I urge everyone who feels strongly about their Post Office to tell me and Royal Mail why it needs to stay open. Let&acirc;&#128;&#153;s make sure Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s voice is heard&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</em></p>

	<p>There are six post offices under threat in the Maidenhead area. In Maidenhead the Post Offices in Wooton Way, Bridge Road, Cookham Road and Norfolk Park are under threat. The Post Office in Knowl Hill is also under threat, as is the Post Office on the High Street in Wargrave.</p>

	<p>On average, 20 per cent of Post Offices are under threat nationwide. Closing six out of 19 Post Offices in Maidenhead would mean that Maidenhead would be losing 31.6 per cent of its Post Offices, 11.6 per cent above the national average.</p>

	<p>The public consultation will last for six weeks from 29 January to 11 March.&Acirc;&nbsp;All branches will display posters and those that are likely to be affected by the proposals in the Area Plan will also provide leaflets giving information about proposed changes for the branch.</p>

	<p>The Post Office Ltd also has a copy of the Area plan proposal available on its website at <a href="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/network">www.postoffice.co.uk/network</a> change. Members of the public responding to the public consultation must be able to outline constructive reasons as to why their Post Office should stay open. To respond in writing to the consultation, people should write to Gary Herbert, Network Development Manager, C/o National Consultation Team, <span class="caps">FREEPOST</span> <span class="caps">CONSULTATION</span> <span class="caps">TEAM</span>, or email <a href="mailto:consultation@postoffice.co.uk">consultation@postoffice.co.uk</a>.</p>

	<p>When submitting to the consultation, it would be very useful if local people forwarded their submission to Theresa as well, so that she can assess the amount of local feeling about each branch.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs campaign against&nbsp;trafficking</h1>


<p class="published">31 January 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May gave her support to the Blue Blindfold Campaign launch in the House of Commons on Tuesday 29th January.&Acirc;&nbsp;The campaign, initiated by the UK Human Trafficking Centre, aims to create greater awareness amongst the public about human trafficking through a series of distinct posters displayed on buses throughout the UK with the message, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t close your eyes to human trafficking&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</p>

	<p>Theresa, who is Shadow Minister for Women, said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;This is an excellent initiative that I fully support. Using eye-catching advertising to alert people to the fact that human trafficking is a reality in our towns and cities will increase awareness of this despicable activity.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>The posters are to appear on First, Arriva/Go Ahead and Stagecoach buses throughout the country including Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Greater London.</p>

	<p>Nick Kinsella, Head of the UK Human Trafficking Centre said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s important for people to realise that this type of crime is not visible. The victims do not have a voice because they are controlled and they are too scared to ask for help. People must open their eyes to the fact that someone in their community or the person down the road could be a trafficked person.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">UKHTC</span>, established in 2006, is the country&acirc;&#128;&#153;s leading centre for expertise helping to deliver operational, tactical and legal support to police forces and other law enforcement agencies engaged in tackling human trafficking. The Blue Blindfold campaign is another example of the ways in which the <span class="caps">UKHTC</span> are tackling this crime.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">UKHTC</span> has acted in an advisory capacity for police operations across the country, a number of which have resulted in successful prosecutions for offences relating to human trafficking.</p>

	<p>Theresa May has reacted to reports of yet another plan for development on Sandford Farm. The latest plan is expected to include provision for 800 houses and 150 care village homes.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Once again the residents of Charvil, Woodley and Hurst are facing an unwanted plan for development on Sandford Farm. This is a monstrous application. The increase in traffic resulting from the previous plan would have been bad enough. Now the developer is planning nearly 1,000 new homes on the site. Local roads simply will not be able to cope, and there will be a significant loss of local amenity. I urge local residents to stand up against this proposal. I will be objecting strongly and I hope the Council take note of local people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s concerns.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">12 March 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May last week presented a petition to Parliament signed by a staggering 1,384 people to keep the Cookham Road Post Office open. The Cookham Road Post Office is one of six Post Offices in the Maidenhead area under threat from closure.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The huge level of local support for Cookham Road Post Office proves how much people want the Post Office to stay open. There has been so much support for each of the six Post Offices and there are good reasons for keeping them all open. I sincerely hope that the Government will take these into account.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Maidenhead has been especially badly hit by the closure programme. There were originally six Post Offices under threat, but now the Post Office at Waltham St Lawrence is also being closed. This means that in the Maidenhead constituency, 35 per cent of Post Offices are under threat, well above the national average of 20 per cent of the Post Office network. In Slough and Windsor, only two Post Offices have been threatened, why is Maidenhead being hit so hard?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Our Post Offices provide an invaluable to the local community they serve. I am delighted that Bridge Road Post Office has been saved but I am deeply disappointed that the Post Office Ltd has chosen to ignore the strength of local feeling and close five of our Post Offices.

	<p><em>&ldquo;As it currently stands, only 24 out of 621 of the Post Offices threatened across the country have been saved from closure and I am pleased that because of the strength of our local campaign, we have ensured that Bridge Road is one of the branches that will be saved.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Appeal for minor injuries unit in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 April 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>On the day that the consultation for the East Berkshire <span class="caps">PCT</span> healthcare plan ends, Theresa May has appealed again for East Berkshire <span class="caps">PCT</span> to reconsider their plans not to build a minor injuries unit at St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Having long campaigned for a minor injuries unit in Maidenhead and other improvements to local healthcare, Theresa will visit St Marks on Monday 14th April to hand over a petition campaigning for a minor injuries unit organised by the Maidenhead Advertiser and signed by thousands of local people.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&ldquo;The healthcare plan for East Berkshire we saw three months ago was a real slap in the face for Maidenhead. Once again, services were to be significantly improved for people living in Slough and Bracknell, at the expense of people in Maidenhead.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;I urge Berkshire East <span class="caps">PCT</span> to show they are listening to what local people want, fulfil the regular promises they have made, and give Maidenhead a minor injuries unit at St Mark&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Hospital.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Hospital consultation covers fewer than one in&nbsp;five</h1>


<p class="published">14 April 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has today raised her concerns about how much local people in the Maidenhead area are being consulted by Berkshire East Primary Care Trust and Berkshire Healthcare Trust about plans to make significant changes to local healthcare services.</p>

	<p>Theresa says: <em>&ldquo;The Right Care, Right Place consultation has been running since January and proposes to make big changes to health services in Maidenhead. Despite repeated assurances that there could be a Minor Injuries Unit at St Marks Hospital, the current plans rule out this option. In addition the consultation raises the prospect of big changes to Charles ward at St Marks, which currently provides an invaluable service to elderly people with mental illnesses.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Only 70,000 consultation booklets and questionnaires were send out to the public &ndash; this is a mere 18 per cent of the population serviced by Berkshire East <span class="caps">PCT</span>.&Acirc;&nbsp;The population of Maidenhead alone is 58,848! How can the Trust say it is giving people a real choice over healthcare and then ignore 82 per cent of us?&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Despite the consultation significantly improving health services in Bracknell and Slough, yet again, Maidenhead is being ignored.&Acirc;&nbsp;Thank goodness for the campaign run by the Maidenhead Advertiser &ndash; without that far fewer people would have been able to have their say on the plans.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes council rethink on Headington Close alley&nbsp;gate</h1>


<p class="published">24 April 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the decision by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead to install an alley gate in Headington Close in Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Following complaints by local residents of Murrin Road and Headington Road, the Council had previously decided to install an alley gate in Murrin Road but ruled against doing the same in Headington Close, arguing that there were not enough reports of crime to justify it.</p>

	<p>However following a successful campaign by Theresa May and other concerned local residents, the Council have now reversed this decision and an alley gate is now in place in Headington Close.</p>

	<p>Commenting on this decision, Theresa said: <em>&ldquo;I am pleased that the Council have listened to what local residents are telling them and decided to install an alley gate at Headington Close after all.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Two years ago a Headington Close resident, Mrs Rene Fairlie, died during a burglary at her house. The Royal Borough had been notified in advance by local residents about continuous disturbances and anti-social behaviour in the area, which made Mrs Fairlie&acirc;&#128;&#153;s death even more tragic.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;It has been proven that alley gates can help to lower the rate of crime and I hope that this gate will help local residents feel safer in their community.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">MPs commend council&acirc;&#128;&#153;s motion on &acirc;&#128;&#152;garden grabbing&acirc;&#128;&#153;</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 May 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Windsor and Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s two Members of Parliament, Theresa May and Adam Afriyie, have today written to the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, Councillor David Burbage, to commend the council&acirc;&#128;&#153;s motion regarding building on gardens.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Planning rules which were brought in during John Prescott&acirc;&#128;&#153;s tenure as Deputy Prime Minister are forcing the demolition of homes with gardens, and their replacement with &acirc;&#128;&#152;high-density&acirc;&#128;&#153; developments.&Acirc;&nbsp;Local residents and their councils are increasingly powerless to prevent the over-development of their neighbourhoods, and infill of green spaces because of Government imposed top-down housing targets.</p>

	<p>The council motion, which was passed on 22nd April 2008, seeks to return powers over local planning decisions to locally elected councillors and follows a long-running campaign by Conservatives against Labour&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#156;garden grab&acirc;&#128;&#157;.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Speaking about the motion, Theresa May said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am pleased that the Royal Borough is addressing the problem of garden grabbing. It is vital that we all work together to protect our local gardens which not only improve people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s personal quality of life, but also the feel of our local community. I know that many people in Maidenhead are concerned about this issue and I will continue to campaign with the Council and with Conservatives locally and nationally for an end to Labour&rsquo;s &lsquo;garden grab&rsquo;.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Adam Afriyie said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that the council are calling for powers over local planning decisions to be returned to local authorities.&Acirc;&nbsp;The insensitive over-development of our constituency is of great concern to me and I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been actively campaigning for the last few years and continue to do so now in Parliament.&Acirc;&nbsp;I would urge local residents to sign the Conservatives petition against Labour&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Garden Grab on the Conservatives website.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa fights to keep local lock&nbsp;keepers</h1>


<p class="published">20 May 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has criticised the Environment Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to sell lock keepers cottages along the Thames and has joined with other Thames Valley MPs to carry on fighting the decision in parliament.</p>

	<p>The Environment Agency had been consulting on the future of the resident lock keepers and their cottages earlier this year. However despite protests it has taken the decision to sell off the cottages, leaving local locks unmanned.</p>

	<p>Commenting on the decision, Theresa said:</p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Environment Agency is trying to save money, but getting rid of resident lock keepers is a false economy. There is no adequate replacement for an experienced resident lock keeper on the river. They are the first point of call in an emergency, performing an essential role fighting floods, and helping the huge number of people who use the river during the summer months.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Many MPs in the area feel strongly about this and we will work together to fight this. I am asking for a meeting with a Minister about the lock keepers and will be signing a parliamentary Early Day Motion calling on the Environment Agency to rethink its decision and work to protect this unique part of the nation&rsquo;s river heritage and the tradition of lock-keepers living at the site of locks.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Good news for St&nbsp;Marks</h1>


<p class="published">27 May 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Berkshire East <span class="caps">PCT</span> has announced that St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead&Acirc;&nbsp;will get a minor injuries unit following consultation on healthcare services in East Berkshire including Maidenhead. Original plans did not include a minor injuries unit for St Mark&rsquo;s but Theresa May joined forces with the Maidenhead Advertiser to campaign for the unit.</p>

	<p>Following the announcement, Theresa said:</p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;I am delighted that, as a result of our campaign, Maidenhead will get a minor injuries unit, albeit as a pilot.&Acirc;&nbsp;I have been pressing for this for some time and was angry that in the Primary Care Trust&rsquo;s original plans they did not include a minor injuries unit at St Mark&rsquo;s. I know how valuable this facility would be for local people who have seen too many services taken away from Maidenhead over the years.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;I was pleased to join forces with the Maidenhead Advertiser to campaign for this extra service at St Mark&rsquo;s. Thousands of people signed the petition supporting the Unit and it is clear that the Trust has listened to what we told them. But it is only a pilot and we will need to keep up the pressure to ensure this unit becomes permanent.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Sadly there&rsquo;s also some bad news for St Mark&rsquo;s. I am extremely disappointed that the Trust has decided to move inpatient services from Charles Ward at St Marks to Upton Park in Slough. During the consultation, people told the Trust what an amazing service the Charles Ward provides. Why should such an excellent service be changed?&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Environment Agency lock keeper case crumbles in face of opposition from local&nbsp;MPs</h1>


<p class="published"> 3 June 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Local MPs will meet a government Minster about the removal of resident lock keepers in the Thames Valley, in light of the poor case put forward by the Environment Agency for their removal.</p>

	<p>Theresa May joined MPs from across the Thames Valley on 1st June to meet officials from the Environment Agency to discuss the proposed removal of resident lock keepers in the Thames Valley, and sale of lock keepers cottages. The meeting, which was also attended by local lock keepers and river users, gave MPs the opportunity to question the Environment Agency about their plans to sell off lock keepers cottages and remove resident lock keepers.</p>

	<p>Theresa, who is campaigning strongly for the lock keepers, said:</p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;From this meeting it became clear just how weak the Environment Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s case for getting rid of our lock keepers is. Environment Agency officials were unable to say how much money they would save, nor could they guarantee that the removal of resident lock keepers wouldn&rsquo;t cost more money than keeping them.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Perhaps most worrying thing was that officials did not seem to realise how much service is provided by resident lock keepers and how important it is to river users. Far from convincing MPs that the cuts were needed, the meeting made MPs realise just how important the lock keepers are. Whether it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s keeping junior rowers safe, stopping anti&acirc;&#128;&#147;social behaviour, or helping to prevent flooding, the resident lock keepers are always the first point of call. We want it to stay that way and we now look forward to putting the lock keepers case across to the Waterways Minster.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa calls for Badnells Pit appeal to be&nbsp;rejected</h1>


<p class="published">11 June 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has continued to support efforts to prevent development on Badnells Pit. The long-running battle to prevent development has now reached the Planning Inspectorate, following an appeal by Michael Shanly Homes against the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s rejection of the plans to develop 402 residential units on the site.</p>

	<p>Theresa has now written to the Planning Inspectorate in support of the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s original decision.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I have campaigned against the proposed development at Badnells Pit. There are numerous problems with the proposals, not least of all the number of new dwellings being suggested. This overdevelopment is completely unjustified as the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead have stated that they have met their development targets for the next six years.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;In addition, the impact of the development on local infrastructure and facilities such as schools, doctors, and nurseries has not been adequately considered in the proposal. That is not to mention the effect on transport infrastructure, and the flood risk posed to the site.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I was delighted that the Royal Borough listened to these concerns and rejected the application. I have written to the Planning Inspectorate to re-state my strong objections. I hope that the Inspectorate will uphold the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s original, and correct, decision.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">23 June 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>The Environment Agency are to rethink their decision to get rid of residential lock keepers in the Thames Valley area, it was announced today.</p>

	<p>The Environment Agency had planned to sell or rent 22 lock keepers properties in the region, meaning that residential lock keepers would have lost their homes and no longer been able to perform their valuable role of keeping people safe on the river, or helping to prevent flooding. Lock keepers at Boulters Lock and Cookham Lock were both under threat.</p>

	<p>But as a result of a meeting last Thursday with Theresa May, who had campaigned against the plans, and the Environment Minister Phil Woolas, the Environment Agency has decided to reconsider its plans, and give the lock keepers a stay of execution until January 2009.</p>

	<p>Commenting on the decision, Theresa said:</p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased that the Environment Agency has shown that it is listening and has decided to reconsider this. We led a strong local campaign and MPs across the region worked together to fight the decision to remove our lock keepers. Our residential lock keepers play a vital role. Whether it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s keeping junior rowers safe, stopping anti&acirc;&#128;&#147;social behaviour, or helping to prevent flooding, the resident lock keepers are always the first point of call. We will continue to campaign to ensure that they stay.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p>On 24th June Scouts from Pinkneys Green joined&Acirc;&nbsp;Theresa May for a tea party with the Speaker of the House of Commons this week.</p>

	<p>Nicholas Jones, a Scout from Pinkneys Green who got the opportunity to visit the Houses of Parliament said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It was a great experience to come to Westminster, in London, to visit the Houses of Parliament.&Acirc;&nbsp;Scouting is all about adventure and trying new experiences.&Acirc;&nbsp;Today certainly reflects that!&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&ldquo;I was delighted to meet some of the Scouts from Pinkneys Green, and that they were given the opportunity to attend such a special event.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p>+&ldquo;I have enjoyed listening to their experiences and learning about the many activities these Scouts have been involved in. It is clear that Scouting continues to be relevant, providing young people with the opportunities to try out new adventures, from trying snowboarding to working with their community. I wish them and The Scout Association the very best of luck in the future.&rdquo;_</p>

	<p>Chief Scout Peter Duncan, speaking at the event, said, <em>&ldquo;The Scouts who have attended today are members of the largest co-educational youth movement in the world. The Scout Association offers challenge and adventure to 28 million people worldwide and 400,000 young people and 100,000 adults across the UK.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I hope the parliamentarians here will agree that Scouting is creating a better world through its work with young people, and has a clear role in encouraging young people to make a positive difference to their communities and to the world.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p>On the 80th anniversary of universal suffrage, Theresa May joined activists outside Parliament calling for greater representation of women in the House of Commons.

<p class="published">16 July 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging Maidenhead students to enter the Parliamentary Press Gallery writing competition 2008-09. Since 2003 the Parliamentary Press Galley has run a writing competition for students, designed to complement citizenship lessons in schools and aimed at pupils in years 10 to 13.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Competition winners get to spend a day in Parliament and will be presented with their award by the Speaker. In previous years winners have also been able to meet Members of Parliament, including those who supported the competition by acting as judges, and the Prime Minister.&Acirc;&nbsp;In addition they have met political journalists from the variety of national and regional newspapers.</p>

	<p>The competition is divided by region and into two age groups. This year the Press Gallery is asking young people in years 10-11 to propose to the Prime Minister the one thing they think would make Britain a better place, whilst those in years 12-13 are being invited to devise an effective media campaign to promote a more positive image of young people.</p>

	<p>A winner from each region will be chosen and then a final judging panel including well-known MPs and journalists will decide upon an overall winner for this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s competition.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The competition provides an exciting opportunity for young people interested in journalism or politics. It is wonderful to see events which promote awareness and discussion of the values of parliamentary democracy and the political process to young people. I encourage all Maidenhead students to give this competition a go. Good Luck!&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Further information, including details of how to enter and the competition rules, can be found on the Press Gallery web site, <a href="http://www.parliamentarypressgallery.org.uk/">www.parliamentarypressgallery.org.uk</a>. The closing date for entries will be 10th November and a number of Parliamentarians are being approached to join parliamentary reporters in the judging process, which will be completed by January 2009.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Theresa May was so impressed with the quality of artwork produced by local students for a recent exhibition that she will be displaying a sample in her House of Commons office.</p>

	<p>Artwork produced by students at Furze Platt Senior School was recently showcased at a special display in the Maidenhead Sainsbury&acirc;&#128;&#153;s. Theresa paid the exhibition a visit and was pleased to be presented with a painting by Year 12 student Alice Marshall. The painting will now be framed and put up in her office in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Displaying artwork produced by young people in the town centre is a great idea. It can act as an encouragement to all students interested in art, and it also brightens up the town centre. The quality of art produced by Furze Platt Senior School was very high and I am sure they are all proud of it. I was delighted to be presented with a piece myself, and I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve decided to frame it in my office in the House of Commons so that anyone who comes to see me will be able to look at it.

<h1 class="article">Bringing the Olympic spirit to&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 August 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May&Acirc;&nbsp;is supporting efforts to see Maidenhead and the surrounding area benefit from London&acirc;&#128;&#153;s hosting of the Olympic Games in 2012. In the week that the 2008 Olympics open, Theresa is encouraging local businesses and sports venues to get involved with the 2012 Games.</p>

	<p>She is encouraging local business to register at <a href="http://www.competefor.com/">www.CompeteFor.com</a>, which publicises Olympic-related business contract opportunities. So far around 50% of contracts have been awarded to businesses outside of London.</p>

	<p>Theresa is also supporting local sporting venues. Four local venues have been included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide, meaning that they might be selected to host a training camp. If any visiting team uses them they will receive &Acirc;&pound;25,000.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Many of us are already looking forward to the vital role that the local area will play during the 2012 Olympics as the host venue for the rowing competitions. However, there are many other ways in which we can benefit from London hosting the Games. It is fantastic that four of our local sports venues have been approved as potential training camp sites and I will be working with them to see what we can do to make this happen by attracting teams to the area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Olympics also represent a great opportunity for local businesses. I urge any local business that thinks it might be able to benefit from the Games to register their interest. I know that some have already done so. There is no reason why it should be only London businesses benefiting from the Games.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes improved flood warning&nbsp;service</h1>


<p class="published">10 September 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May&Acirc;&nbsp;has welcomed improvements to the flood warning service which will allow for more targeted local information to be accessed by people concerned about flooding.</p>

	<p>The new measures, announced by the Environment Agency, will allow local residents to access specific information about flooding in their area. This follows improvements to the Environment Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s flood warning system on the Rivers Loddon and Thames. The changes mean that people can use a quickdial number specific to their local area when calling the Floodline. People can also sign up to receive flood warning messages directly by telephone, <span class="caps">SMS</span> text, email or pager message.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am pleased that the Environment Agency has taken these steps to improve the quality of information that the public can access about flooding. I recently met with the Environment Agency to discuss this so I welcome their announcement. It has been a problem in the past that information on flooding has been far too generalised, so people didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t really know whether their specific neighbourhood was at risk. Hopefully this will now change, and I encourage anyone concerned about flooding to sign up to receive flood warning messages.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>The Environment Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Floodline number is 0845 988 1188.&Acirc;&nbsp;The Floodline quickdial numbers for the local area are as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>River Loddon at Twyford, Charvil and Wargrave &acirc;&#128;&#147; 173209</li>
		<li>River Thames at Marlow and Bisham &acirc;&#128;&#147; 173102</li>
		<li>River Thames at Bourne End &acirc;&#128;&#147; 173103</li>
		<li>River Thames at Cookham &acirc;&#128;&#147; 173104</li>
		<li>River Thames at Maidenhead to Windsor and Eton &acirc;&#128;&#147; 173105</li>

<h1 class="article">Theresa launches equal pay&nbsp;campaign</h1>


<p class="published">18 September 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is today launching a campaign for equal pay for women.&Acirc;&nbsp;The campaign is supported by TV presenter June Sarpong who recently launched the website &acirc;&#128;&#152;Politics &amp; the City&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Theresa May for Equal Pay&acirc;&#128;&#153; will launch today as a <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?sid=ced820955a59b78964bba7931010dc8a&amp;refurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.new.facebook.com%2Fs.php%3Fref%3Dsearch%26init%3Dq%26q%3Dtheresa%2Bmay%2Bfor%2Bequal%2Bpay%26sid%3Dced820955a59b78964bba7931010dc8a&amp;gid=38527564480" target="_blank">group on Facebook</a> and aims to generate greater awareness about the gender pay gap which still affects women today.&Acirc;&nbsp;Despite the Government&Acirc;&nbsp;passing many pieces of legislation to try and stamp out the pay gap, men still get paid 17.2 per cent more than women, meaning that the average woman will lose or forgo a massive &Acirc;&pound;300,000 over her lifetime. This pay gap does not just exist in low paid part-time jobs but also with women working in full-time jobs who earn less than men.</p>

	<p>The campaign aims to tackle the pay gap by not just passing a law, but by raising awareness of the gender pay gap, especially amongst young people. The Equal Pay and Flexible Working Bill will be launched in the House of Lords at Christmas, and the hope is to gain cross party support for the Bill.</p>

	<h3>
<span class="caps">STANDARD</span> <span class="caps">LETTER</span> TO <span class="caps">SEND</span> TO MPs</h3>

	<p>Dear&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;.MP</p>

	<p><em>Equal Pay and Flexible Working Act 2008</em></p>

	<p>I am writing to you today to ask for your assistance as my MP to help stamp out the gender pay gap &ndash; an issue I feel strongly about.</p>

	<p>It is the 21st century and despite a lot of legislation being passed, a large gender pay gap still exists. Men still get paid 17.2 per cent more than women meaning that the average woman will lose or forgo a massive &Acirc;&pound;300,000 over her lifetime. This pay gap does not only exist in the lower paid job sectors &ndash; full-time women earn less than full-time men in every occupation.</p>

	<p>I think that this pay gap is unacceptable and want to help to stamp it out once and for all. The Equal Pay and Flexible Working Bill (HL) will be presented to the House of Lords in December. The Bill contains three tough measures designed to tackle the pay gap: compulsory pay audits for employers who are found guilty of pay discrimination at an employment tribunal, a &acirc;&#128;&#152;reasonableness test&acirc;&#128;&#153; for the material factor defence used by employers at employment tribunals; and, an extension of flexible working to all parents of children aged 18 or younger.</p>

	<p>This Bill will be introduced by the Conservative Party. However for the Bill to become law it needs the support of all political parties. The gender pay gap is not just a political issue &ndash; it is so much more than that. Therefore as my MP I would be grateful if you could forward my email to the Leader of your Party in the House of Lords asking them and their colleagues to give their support to the Equal Pay and Flexible Working Bill (HL).</p>

	<p>I would also appreciate it if you could write to me confirming that you will support the Bill, should it reach the House of Commons. Thank you for reading this email and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

	<p>Yours sincerely&hellip;</p>

<h1 class="article">Walk to school&nbsp;month</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 October 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging children in the Maidenhead constituency to make a special effort to walk to school this October as part of Walk to School Month. The month will see children around Maidenhead and throughout the country discover the health benefits of regular walking.</p>

	<p>Only one-third of boys and girls aged 2-11 achieve the recommended level of activity to benefit their health through activity undertaken outside of school. By encouraging families to ditch the car keys and get to school on foot, this month of activities will highlight that it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not just PE lessons that are needed to give children the healthiest start &acirc;&#128;&#147; it is how active you are in your daily life that really matters.</p>

	<p>Teachers often report that those pupils who walk to school are more attentive in class.&Acirc;&nbsp;By simply walking to school and back each day, the average child will already be spending more time physically active than is provided for by the national curriculum.</p>

	<p>Theresa commented: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Increasing the number of children walking to school has a positive impact not only in increasing the health levels of children, but also in reducing the levels of congestion and pollution in our local area. I am encouraging all children in the Maidenhead area to make a special effort, where possible, to walk to school this month.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">21 October 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May visted St. Piran&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Preparatory School on Monday to award the newly elected members of the School Parliament their badges.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Theresa&Acirc;&nbsp;answered questions from the children, ranging from <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;How long she has been an MP?&acirc;&#128;&#157; to &acirc;&#128;&#156;Has she met the President of the United States?&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</em></p>

	<p>St. Piran&acirc;&#128;&#153;s School Parliament has been running for many years and is composed of 14 children elected by their fellow pupils, who serve for a whole school year.&Acirc;&nbsp;St. Piran&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Headmaster Jonathan Carroll said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The children were very excited to meet Theresa and really enjoyed asking her about her life as an MP.&Acirc;&nbsp;We are very proud of our School Parliament; they are making a real difference to the life of the school&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</em></p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I was delighted to visit St Piran&acirc;&#128;&#153;s School and meet the new members of the School Parliament. It is always good to see young people taking an interest in the workings of their school and I am sure that the new School Parliament will make a valuable contribution. I hope that the children enjoy their experience, and maybe it will convince some of them to one day stand for the Westminster Parliament as well&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses the Government on Equitable&nbsp;Life</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 November 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Having received around 100 letters from concerned constituents in the past few months, Theresa May has stepped up the pressure on the Government to announce whether it will compensate policyholders who lost out as a result of failures in Equitable Life.</p>

	<p>Theresa has asked the Government on several occasions to say whether policyholders will be compensated. Harriet Harman, the Leader of the House of Commons, has repeatedly promised that the Government would make a statement <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;in her autumn&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. On Thursday, Theresa questioned Ms Harman in the Commons, saying <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The clocks have changed and London has had its first snowfall. Does she still think that it is autumn, or will she now give us a date for a statement on Equitable Life?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Following a request from local campaigner Liz Kwantes, Theresa will be discussing the issue further with representatives of Equitable Life next week at a meeting of the company with MPs.</p>

	<p>Theresa commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Many local residents have contacted me with concerns about Equitable Life. The Government has promised to tell us what it plans to do about this, yet we are now in November and there is still no sign of any statement.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes decision to keep Post Office card account with Post&nbsp;Offices</h1>


<p class="published">17 November 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to listen to the calls from thousands of local campaigners and MPs and renew the contract for the Post Office Card Account with the Post Office. The account is currently used by nearly four million people to receive their state pensions, benefit payments and tax credits and if a private company had won the contract this could have meant another nail in the coffin for the already beleaguered Post Office network.</p>

	<p>In Maidenhead, Theresa received campaign cards from many constituents asking her to support the Post Office&acirc;&#128;&#153;s bid to retain the contract and save further closures.</p>

	<p>Theresa commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;This is brilliant news for our local post offices and the postmasters who work so hard to keep them going. Despite a strong local campaign Maidenhead has already seen the loss of five Post Offices recently. If a private company had won the card account our remaining branches would be even more vulnerable. The Post Offices provide an invaluable service and we cannot afford to see any more lost in our area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Theresa May is continuing to campaign against car parking charges that were introduced in St Marks Hospital at the beginning of November.

	<p>The controversial scheme was approved by the <span class="caps">PCT</span> in the summer despite a strong local campaign and a petition presented by Theresa, a group of local traders and residents. Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am still strongly opposed to the introduction of car parking charges at St Marks. They are being brought in against the will of hospital staff, local residents and the people of Maidenhead who use the community hospital.

<h1 class="article">Theresa urges carers to find out about&nbsp;support</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 December 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is backing Carers UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s national carers&acirc;&#128;&#153; rights campaign ahead of Carers Rights Day on Friday 5th December 2008.</p>

	<p>There are over six million unpaid carers in the UK who provide care support to family, friends and neighbours, saving the country an estimated &Acirc;&pound;87 billion each year. The Carers Rights Day campaign, run by Carers UK, seeks to increase the take-up of benefits and raise awareness of carers&acirc;&#128;&#153; rights and the support that they may be able to get. It might be the Carer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Allowance, meals on wheels, council tax discount or practical support caring that makes a difference.</p>

	<p>Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Carers play a vital role in our society and without them thousands of vulnerable people would not receive the care and support that they need. But carers themselves need support and it is essential that they are not living in poverty as a result of all their work. It is concerning that many carers in Maidenhead and the surrounding area may not be getting all the help that they are entitled to and we need to make sure that they are given information about their rights. That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s why I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m backing Carers Rights Day.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Carers UK are urging carers to get in touch with its helpline, CarersLine (0808 808 7777 or <a href="http://www.carersuk.org/">www.carersuk.org</a>). Imelda Redmond, Chief Executive said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Nearly three quarters of carers are financially worse-off as a result of caring, with many falling into poverty and debt. Yet around &Acirc;&pound;740 million per year in carers benefits go unclaimed. Carers must get clear information on what they are entitled to, and how to claim it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Carers can order a free booklet called Looking after someone: a guide to carers&acirc;&#128;&#153; rights and benefits&Acirc;&nbsp; from Carers UK by visiting <a href="http://www.carersuk.org/">www.carersuk.org</a> or calling the free phone hotline on 0808 808 7777.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa challenges M.O.D decision to block local people showing support for the&nbsp;troops</h1>


<p class="published"> 3 December 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has written to the Ministry of Defence to question their decision to prevent members of the public sending Christmas gifts to British troops to thank them for their service. Many people, including the local Rotary Clubs in Loddon Vale and Bourne End &amp; Cookham, have in the past sent shoeboxes full of gifts to troops at Christmas time. However, the Ministry of Defence has decided to prevent the packages being sent due to &acirc;&#128;&#152;logistical problems&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</p>

	<p>Theresa is backing a new appeal by the Conservative Future Social Action Network which seeks to ensure that the packages can still get to the troops, despite the MOD&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision. <span class="caps">CFSAN</span> have been collecting names of front-line troops who are willing to receive a package and distribute the contents to their colleagues. Packages directly addressed to troops should still be delivered.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Christmas parcels are a valuable way for the public to show their support for our troops abroad, and it is very disappointing that they should be prevented from showing their support. I know that many local people would be disappointed if this meant they missed out on the chance to thank the troops for their service.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is a shame that the Ministry of Defence are making this so difficult, but I hope that local residents will be able to support the Conservative Future Social Action Network appeal and ensure that our troops of aware of how grateful we all are for their service.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Victory for lock keepers&nbsp;campaign</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 December 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>The Environment Agency have announced a U-turn on their decision to get rid of residential lock keepers in the Thames Valley area. After six months of reviewing their initial decision, the Environment Agency has decided to retain ownership of the 52 lock houses that are either on or adjacent to lock sites and thus retain the invaluable skills of the lock keepers. Theresa May has welcomed the announcement, particularly as lock keepers at Boulters Lock and Cookham Lock were both under threat.</p>

	<p>Theresa pointed out that the Environment Agency were very unlikely to make any real savings through the disposal of lock houses. She also expressed anger that there would be a reduction in the standard of service to river users at a time when boaters on the Thames face an inflation busting 12% hike in navigation licenses each year for three years.</p>

	<p>Commenting on the decision, Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am thrilled that the Environment Agency has listened to a strong local campaign by MPs, river users and the lock keepers wives, and decided to keep the residential lock keepers. MPs across the region worked together to fight the decision at every step of the way and this is a victory for common sense.&ldquo;&Acirc;&nbsp;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;From our discussions with the Environment Agency it became clear just how weak their case for getting rid of the lock keepers was. The Environment Agency officials were not able to provide exact figures for proposed savings and furthermore they could not even guarantee that the removal of resident lock keepers wouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t cost more money than keeping them.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p>They agreed to review their decision following a meeting organised by Theresa May and Martin Salter, MP for Reading West, with the then Environment Minister at Cookham Lock.</p>

	<p>Theresa continued, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Environment Agency&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision will help to protect this unique part of the nation&rsquo;s river heritage and the tradition of lock keepers living at the site of locks. Our residential lock keepers play a vital role from ensuring the safety of the public who enjoy the waterways to stopping anti&acirc;&#128;&#147;social behaviour, or even helping to prevent flooding. The resident lock-keepers are always the first point of call and I am thrilled that they will continue with their important jobs.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Kim Benge of Cookham Lock said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;We are thrilled with the news today regarding the lock houses, much work still needs to be done but we are truly delighted with this outcome and we can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t begin to thank all the people who have supported the lock keepers and their families enough, the River Thames is a safer place today because of it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa defends local interest as Crossrail steps up a&nbsp;gear</h1>


<p class="published">15 December 2008</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has continued to stand up for the interests of Maidenhead and Twyford in the face of the Crossrail development. In a meeting with senior executives from Crossrail she raised local concerns over the level of services provided and the impact the project will have on the community.</p>

	<p>On 8th December, Cross London Rail Links, the company developing the &Acirc;&pound;16 billion scheme, became a directly controlled subsidiary of Transport for London, sparking fears that the scheme was becoming overly focussed on the capital at the expense of Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;As MP for Maidenhead my main concerns about Crossrail have always been about the benefits that it will bring to the area. I strongly believe that the service from Maidenhead will deteriorate as a result of Crossrail; the journey time from Maidenhead to Paddington will be forty minutes &acirc;&#128;&#147; almost double that of the current fast First Great Western services.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Furthermore, Maidenhead has no desire to be part of London&rsquo;s transport scheme. I am particularly concerned that Transport for London now has full responsibility for the line through to its terminus at Maidenhead as we were told the project would be part of the main rail network. I have written to Peter Hendy, Commissioner for Transport for London, asking for his assurance that the interests of Maidenhead will not be sidelined.&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I will continue to keep a close eye on Crossrail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s developments to ensure that we receive the kind of service that a busy and thriving commuter area like ours deserves.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

The meeting on Wednesday could see the approval of nearly 500 dwellings on Sandford Farm near Woodley. The Council sent an email on 29th December giving people just 7 working days before a final decision is made.</p>

	<p>Theresa&Acirc;&nbsp;commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am disappointed that the Council has allowed such a short period of time for objectors to prepare. These plans have been overwhelmingly opposed by local residents at every opportunity and their concerns need to be heard. People recognise that packing in more homes where they are not suitable is not a sensible solution. There is simply not the infrastructure to support such a development at Sandford Farm.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Recycle Christmas cards and help the&nbsp;environment</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 January 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is supporting the Woodland Trust&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme. Each year the Trust collects cards, all of which are taken to paper mills where they are recycled into brand new paper products, with money raised helping the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s leading woodland conservation charity plant thousands of trees.</p>

	<p>Last year, the public recycled an impressive total of 73.6 million Christmas cards which enabled the Woodland Trust to plant 17,000 trees. If everyone recycles just one Christmas card this year it will raise enough funds to plant a further 15,000 trees.</p>

	<p>Theresa will be recycling her own Christmas cards on Thursday 8th January when she visits the Maidenhead branch of Marks &amp; Spencer.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Cards are an important part of our Christmas tradition but without proper recycling they can result in a lot of waste paper. That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s why I strongly support the Woodland Trust&acirc;&#128;&#153;s recycling scheme, which ensures that Christmas cards are recycled and the money raised put into planting new trees. I will be recycling my Christmas cards and I hope all local residents will join me.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published"> 8 January 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has&Acirc;&nbsp;continued her long-running campaign to bring broadband to Waltham St Lawrence and parts of Hurst. She has taken her quarrel with BT to the Communications Minister, Lord Carter, asking him to work with broadband suppliers to achieve better access to fast internet in the local area.</p>

	<p>Theresa&Acirc;&nbsp;commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am surprised that despite claiming broadband development is one of their top four communications priorities, the Government has not taken more decisive action. BT has given a number of excuses and promises but has failed to provide an adequate service to rural areas. This is a postcode lottery and leaves many homeworkers and small businesses at a distinct disadvantage against competitors with reliable and fast connections. It is entirely unacceptable that two centrally located and easily accessible villages on the commuter belt are being left behind in the communications race.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Theresa commented, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that Wokingham Borough Council has seen sense and rejected this application. The area simply couldn&rsquo;t cope with this development. This number of houses need a solid infrastructure to support them and that simply is not there. The local roads could not cope with the increase in traffic and the loss of amenity would be severe.

<h1 class="article">Theresa shows support for holocaust memorial&nbsp;day</h1>


<p class="published">27 January 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has shown her commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day by signing a Book of Commitment in the House of Commons to honour those who perished in the Holocaust.</p>

	<p>As in previous years, the Holocaust Educational Trust placed the Book of Commitment in the House of Commons to give MPs the opportunity to pledge that they will uphold the memory of the Holocaust and oppose hatred today.</p>

	<p>January 27th marks the anniversary of the liberation in 1945 of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the infamous concentration and extermination camp. On and around Holocaust Memorial Day, schools, local communities and faith groups from across the UK will join together to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Thousands of events are being held across the country to commemorate all those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust and in more recent genocides.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Holocaust Memorial Day is an important opportunity to remember the horrors of the Holocaust and other genocides. It is essential that we continue to educate young people about the Holocaust so that it will never be forgotten, and I support the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust in doing this. We should all renew our commitment to fight against hatred, prejudice and genocide.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>Karen Pollock, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;We are delighted that Theresa May is supporting Holocaust Memorial Day. Holocaust Memorial Day and Holocaust education is more important now than ever. This year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s topic, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Stand Up to Hatred&acirc;&#128;&#153; highlights the importance of joining forces against hatred, prejudice and intolerance. Sadly antisemitism, Islamaphobia, Holocaust denial, racism, prejudice and even genocide still continue to pollute our world today.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published">29 January 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has been honoured by the charity Working Families for her work to make life better for Britain&acirc;&#128;&#153;s families. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Working Families, Theresa has been named as one of their thirty Pioneers &acirc;&#128;&#152;who have led the way in the work-life field and who have changed the landscape for working families.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</p>

	<p>The Pioneers are from the political, business, academic and carers&acirc;&#128;&#153; fields. Theresa has been honoured for &acirc;&#128;&#152;championing a modern Conservative commitment to equality and work-life balance&acirc;&#128;&#153;.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted to have been recognised by Working Families in this way. Throughout my time in Parliament I have championed policies that help families and particularly those that will encourage a better work-life balance for parents and carers. Many parents and carers work very hard to balance their jobs and their family responsibilities and I believe all MPs should be looking to make life easier for them.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Sarah Jackson <span class="caps">OBE</span>, Chief Executive of Working Families said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;These thirty individuals are honoured for having significantly changed the landscape over the last three decades for working families, whether by their actions, their ideas or their example&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</p>

	<p>Working Families is the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s leading work-life balance campaign organisation. It supports and gives a voice to working parents and carers, whilst also helping employers create workplaces which encourage work-life balance for everyone.</p>

	<p>Theresa May is disappointed that despite a strong campaign led by her and local residents the plan to build over 402 homes on the Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit site has been approved.</p>

	<p>Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I strongly believe that this is the wrong decision for the local community and am hugely disappointed with the Secretary of State&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to give it the green light. The Royal Borough has already met their development targets for the next six years and this is yet another case of over-development of the Maidenhead area.

<p class="published">17 February 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern about the rise in unemployment in Maidenhead and the surrounding area. New figures show that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits has increased by 84% since last year in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and by 127% in Wokingham Borough. The increase in Wokingham was the highest in the South East.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: <i>&acirc;&#128;&#156;These are very worrying figures as behind the statistics are families whose lives have been turned upside down and who are understandably worried about the future. These figures are confirmation that the recession is hitting home across the country. I know from a recent visit how hard the staff at the Maidenhead JobCentre Plus are working to provide support to this increasing number of unemployed people locally. Unfortunately all we are getting from the Government at the moment is a series of announcements on employment that are more spin than substance.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</i></p>

I have called on Grundon to set out exactly how this fire started and to fully assess the procedures that were in place to deal with it.

<h1 class="article">Threat to Maidenhead area's housing market as new rules make it harder to buy and sell&nbsp;homes</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 April 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern for the Maidenhead area&acirc;&#128;&#153;s housing market following the introduction of complex and expensive new Home Information Pack rules. </p>

	<p>From 6 April, extra Home Information Pack (<span class="caps">HIP</span>) regulations will hinder sellers from putting their homes onto the market, potentially mislead buyers and create a real danger of &Acirc;&pound;200 fines from town hall officials.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>New delays if you sell your home: The &acirc;&#128;&#152;first day marketing&acirc;&#128;&#153; provision is being cancelled &acirc;&#128;&#147; which allowed sellers to market their home if a <span class="caps">HIP</span> had been ordered, but had not yet been completed. Sellers will now have to wait even longer before they can put up a &acirc;&#128;&#152;For Sale&acirc;&#128;&#153; sign.</li>
		<li>New Property Information Questionnaires: Also from 6 April, <span class="caps">HIP</span>s must have a so-called &acirc;&#128;&#152;Property Information Questionnaire&acirc;&#128;&#153; completed by the seller. Theresa feels that the Questionnaire is useless as unscrupulous sellers can sidestep difficult questions that could reduce their house price by ticking a &acirc;&#128;&#156;don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know&acirc;&#128;&#157; box. The buyer cannot be certain that the information is reliable about such things as past dry rot or damp, insurance claims, experience of flooding, and whether past alterations had official permission. Honest sellers will also suffer, as disputes over information in Property Information Questionnaires will end up in the courts, with buyers suing sellers.</li>
		<li>Town hall fines: Town halls have been instructed to &acirc;&#128;&#156;identify specific cases of non-compliance and enforce the requirements&acirc;&#128;&#157; &acirc;&#128;&#147; and start fining homeowners &Acirc;&pound;200 a time if they do not follow the new rules.</li>
		<li>Theresa believes that the <span class="caps">HIP</span>s are already harming the housing market: Research has found that there is little public knowledge about, or interest in <span class="caps">HIP</span>s; that the industry thinks they are a waste of time; that they duplicate costs and that buyers are not bothering to consult <span class="caps">HIP</span>s.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very concerned that these new regulations will make things even worse in a housing market that is already struggling. Home Information Packs have already damaged the market and discouraged sellers. Unfortunately these regulations will lead to more wasted time and money. I think that the Government needs to scrap Home Information Packs outright and help those who want to move up the housing ladder.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<p class="published"> 6 May 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has published new figures showing the extent of the collapse in the housing market across the Maidenhead area. </p>

	<p>Parliamentary Questions have revealed that across the country, the number of housing sales in 2008 halved compared to 2006 levels. The latest national figures so far for 2009 show even sharper falls have happened this year. In Windsor and Maidenhead there were 1,625 housing sales in 2008, compared to 3,589 in 2006 &acirc;&#128;&#147; a fall of 55%. In Wokingham there has been a 53% fall.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;These figures confirm what we already know &acirc;&#128;&#147; this recession has sent Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s housing market into freefall. In the current financial climate homeowners and buyers need all the help that they can get. I want to see immediate action to revive the market, by measures such as reducing moving costs for home owners or giving some extra help to first time buyers who find themselves unable to get onto the property ladder.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Maidenhead has benefited from a huge housing boom and dramatic rises in property prices &acirc;&#128;&#147; we want to ensure that young and old people alike can still afford to come and live in the area and help our economy thrive.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa pledges support for local&nbsp;carers</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 June 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is backing this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Carers Week (8-14 June) in support of carers in the Maidenhead area, who are among the six million people in the UK who provide unpaid care for a loved one who is ill, frail or disabled. </p>

	<p>Theresa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s support comes as new research reveals that almost three-quarters (74%) of carers have reached breaking point due to the pressures of their role. The results show that the strain of caring is causing some carers such extreme levels of stress and depression that they are suffering breakdowns and, in some cases, even attempting suicide. </p>

	<p>The Carers Week survey has also highlighted that the vast majority of carers feel their role is overlooked or ignored by professionals (87%), friends (78%) and family members (76%). Almost two-thirds (63%) say that their lives are made &acirc;&#128;&#152;much more difficult&acirc;&#128;&#153; as a result, with more than half saying that it has affected their health and left them worse off financially. </p>

	<p>Theresa has joined the call for carers to receive more recognition. She will be visiting the Carers Stall in the Nicholson&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Shopping Centre in Maidenhead on Friday 12th June to show her support.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted to be supporting Carers Week, which I hope will raise the profile of people who care for others because of an illness or disability, or for a range of other reasons. It is important that carers know about the support that is available to them.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;There are thousands of carers in the Maidenhead area, including young carers under the age of 18, all of whom make considerable sacrifices to care for a loved one. I want to recognise the contribution that they make to our local community, as well as to the whole of the nation.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Carers can find out more about local events and activities taking place as part of Carers Week, by visiting www.carersweek.org or calling 0845 241 2582.</p>

<p class="published"> 9 July 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has commented on the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s new consultation on flooding. Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Maidenhead residents know all too well the damage that flooding can cause and I am pleased the Government is taking flooding risks more seriously. However, I am concerned the draft Bill fails to tackle the root causes of flooding.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I have been calling for some time for dredging of the River Thames to recommence to reduce the risk of flooding. I also think the Government should accept the impact of planning policies on this issue &acirc;&#128;&#147; we must stop building large developments such as Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit on a flood plain.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I also remain concerned about the flood risk posed to parts of the constituency not covered by the Jubilee River, such as Wargrave, Hurley, Bisham and Cookham.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<div class="article-body">
	<p>Recently published figures show an increase in the number of people using St Marks Minor Injuries Unit in the past few months.

	<p>Theresa is now encouraging people to sign her petition so we can keep this invaluable service which 6,917 patients have benefited from so far.</p>

This is an important service for Maidenhead which is a real improvement in our local <span class="caps">NHS</span> facilities. We need it to be made permanent so please help keep the Minor Injuries Unit at St Marks Hospital open.

<p class="published">15 July 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&rsquo;s announcement that it will be conducting a study into the feasibility of expanding Oldfield Primary School. The school is regularly over-subscribed meaning that many parents miss out on their first choice of school for their child.</p>

	<p>However, the council is now looking at the option of building on a new site close to the current school in order to expand capacity. A feasibility study will be discussed by the council before any final decisions are taken. If the plan is approved then the new site could be located in Bray Road, a short distance from the current site in Chiltern Road.</p>

	<p>Demand for the 30 places at Oldfield has greatly increased in recent years, from 78 in 2006/7 to 99 in 2009/10.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I very much welcome the action that the council is taking to address the over-subscription at Oldfield. I know from the emails I receive that this is a very popular local school, and unfortunately many parents go disappointed each year when their child cannot get in. All local children should have the choice of a good school and I look forward to seeing the results of the feasibility study.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published"> 3 August 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has criticised the Department of Health after it sent out misleading information about swine flu which listed St Marks Hospital as being in Slough not Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>The Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, sent the information to MPs detailing all of the anti-viral collection points in England. These are the locations where medicine can be collected on behalf of people who are suffering from swine flu. However, the information stated that St Marks Hospital was in Slough, not in Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Health Secretary to seek assurances that mistakes will not be made in the future.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is a rudimentary mistake, but sadly it is not the first time they have given out misleading information about the local collection point. I would have expected all the Government&rsquo;s information to be correct first time. This is not just an embarrassing mistake &acirc;&#128;&#147; it could have serious consequences if people are misdirected as to where they can collect this medicine. I want everyone to be assured that this service is available in Maidenhead but unfortunately the Government have given the impression that local people would have to travel to Slough. It is essential that no more mistakes are made in dealing with this important issue.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Concern over moves to weaken powers of local councils to control over-development</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 August 2009</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has attacked proposed changes to planning rules, which will reduce the powers of the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough Council to control out-of-town retail development.</p>

	<p>The changes come in the form of new national planning rules on retail development. Local councils will have to observe the rules when assessing planning applications. The new regime will scrap the &acirc;&#128;&#152;needs test&acirc;&#128;&#153;, which requires developers to prove the &acirc;&#128;&#152;need&acirc;&#128;&#153; for additional out-of-town development.</p>

	<p>A new report from a cross-party House of Commons Committee has warned that the proposed changes to planning rules on retail development will result in &acirc;&#128;&#156;many more out-of-town superstores&acirc;&#128;&#157;. This comes as a separate nationwide survey by the British Retail Consortium has found that 1 in 10 of all town centre shops are now vacant.</p>

	<p>The Government consultation exercise found that the changes would &acirc;&#128;&#156;lead to more edge-of and out-of-centre development&acirc;&#128;&#157; and &acirc;&#128;&#156;undermine regeneration schemes by allowing development outside town centres&acirc;&#128;&#157;. On top of this, a Committee of MPs has now warned that the changes will lead to &acirc;&#128;&#156;unnecessary risks to town centres&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very concerned that the Government is rewriting the rules which have protected against excessive out-of-town retail developments. Local councils need the power to stop unsuitable developments. This move could undermine their ability to protect our green open spaces and to protect town centres including in Maidenhead.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<div class="article-body">
	<p>After the recent High Court ruling which found Corby Borough Council liable for allowing pregnant women to be exposed to toxic waste, Theresa May has raised further fears over the remediation of a former landfill site at Badnells Pit. </p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This case puts beyond doubt the link between exposure to toxic waste and birth defects. I have contacted the Council to ensure they have a robust plan prepared in case there is a dangerous toxic leak from the Badnell&rsquo;s Pit site, such as in Corby. No contingency plan exists at the moment to cope with such a scenario, and it is up to Councillors to approve one.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Unless the Council can guarantee the safety of people close to the site &acirc;&#128;&#147; and with the current information available, I do not believe they can do that &acirc;&#128;&#147; then this development should not go ahead.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May has hailed a successful result for the campaign run by her and local residents to bring broadband to Waltham St Lawrence and parts of Hurst.

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is fantastic news for the residents of Waltham St Lawrence who have been fighting for broadband access for so long. We ran a successful campaign, meeting BT on a number of occasions and lobbying the Government and I am pleased to see it has paid off.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;It was absolutely ridiculous that a village on the commuter belt was being left behind in the communications stakes. This is only a pilot at this stage but I hope it will herald a new commitment to universal access to broadband.&rdquo;  </p>

	<p>Theresa May has reacted angrily after First Great Western announced a hike of over 25% on car parking charges at Maidenhead and Twyford train stations. Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;These huge increases in car parking charges are outrageous and yet another way of raising revenue from rail users who are already paying large fares.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The introduction of the RinGo service will cushion the blow for some but I still believe <span class="caps">FGW</span> assume they can get away with large increases as they are effectively a monopoly provider.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>&ldquo;I will be taking this up with <span class="caps">FGW</span> and the Department of Transport and asking for an explanation as to where this money will be spent and where local rail users will see improvements.

	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern over the news that Maidenhead business rates could go up by more than 50% in the new financial year. With the economy still in recession this rise could leave small businesses struggling to survive.</p>

Theresa said, &ldquo;This is devastating news for local businesses. In Maidenhead and the surrounding area many of our local shops and village stores provide a valuable service to their community and I am extremely concerned that this rise in business rates may force some of these stores to close in what are extremely difficult times.

<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has opened a new footbridge and passenger lifts at Twyford railway station as part of a scheme to improve access. The new footbridge, lift and stairs will make access between the station entrance, ticket office and all five platforms much easier for everyone, particularly those with reduced mobility.</p>

	<p>Theresa commented, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Twyford is a key station for London and Reading bound commuters. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m delighted that these essential improvements are now open and providing passengers with step-free access around the station. It will make a real difference to all passengers, from people with disabilities to those carrying heavy luggage and parents with pushchairs.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Chris Rayner, Network Rail route director, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Network Rail is committed to providing facilities which make rail use easier, safer and more accessible for everyone, including people with disabilities and those with heavy luggage or small children.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>First Great Western&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Head of Stations, Mark Heffernan, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The completion of this scheme is a real benefit for our customers travelling to or from Twyford and those changing at Twyford into our popular branch line service to Henley on Thames. Safety and our customers are our first priorities. The installation of this bridge creates step free access across the station which is great for our existing customers and creates easier travel opportunities for potential customers with disabilities who may wish to travel to or from Twyford in the future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;  </p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;There are a number of challenges facing women wanting to take part in sport. Time constraints, childcare, transport, cost, friends to go with and self confidence can all represent barriers to women&acirc;&#128;&#153;s participation. I would encourage local groups in Maidenhead to visit the Sport England website and find out how to apply for funding. Possible projects could include setting up networks for running and &acirc;&#128;&#152;taster&acirc;&#128;&#153; sessions in popular team sports.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>Details of the Active Women fund, including the prospectus, how to apply and frequently asked questions, are available on Sport England&acirc;&#128;&#153;s funding website: www.sportengland.org/funding. The closing date for applications is 3 February 2010.</p>

<p class="published">30 June 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement by six local schools that they are investigating Academy status under the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s education reforms. The headteachers of the six schools have jointly written to the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, indicating their interest in exploring Academy status, which would bring additional freedoms away from control of the local authority.</p>

	<p>The headteachers of Newlands Girls&acirc;&#128;&#153; School, Altwood Church of England School, Cox Green School, Desborough School and Furze Platt Senior School have all stated their support for the move, alongside the headteacher of Holyport Manor School, which will open on a new site in September. </p>

	<p>The schools &acirc;&#128;&#147; who together make up the Maidenhead Federation partnership &acirc;&#128;&#147; are planning to work together as they simultaneously consider a move toward Academy status whilst remaining distinct entities. Their announcement follows the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s invitation to every school in the country to become an Academy.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I strongly welcome the interest that these six local schools have shown in becoming Academies. This will be a big boost to education in the local area. By freeing schools from local authority control and giving them greater independence we can drive up education standards and ensure that it is teachers, not officials, who are in charge. I look forward to discussing this further with the headteachers and giving my support to their work.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May has written to Ian Trenholm, Chief Executive of the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead, asking him to explain why the council did not object to the doubling in the number of vehicles a day going in and out of the Badnell&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pit site in Maidenhead during remediation works.</p>

	<p>Originally 51 vehicles were allowed to leave the site on a daily basis but the Planning Inspector&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision means that up to 100 can leave the site each day. </p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am extremely disappointed that the Royal Borough failed to write to the Inspector and warn against the impact of the doubling in number of <span class="caps">HGV</span> vehicles accessing the site.

<p class="published">30 July 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has praised efforts to improve customer safety at stations in her constituency. In a letter addressed to local Station Manager, Andrew Dickinson, Theresa highlighted the number of rural stations which have been accredited and reaccredited under the Department for Transport&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Secure Stations Scheme in the local area.</p>

	<p>Stations including Cookham, Maidenhead and Twyford have all achieved the national status, which recognises stations that have worked with police officers and other local partners to implement the best possible security measures. </p>

	<p>The accreditation also draws on crime figures and customers&acirc;&#128;&#153; opinions and further recognises that security can be increased through improvements to station design, as well as good management.</p>

	<p>Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s great to see the DfT awarding First Great &lsquo;Secure Stations Status&rsquo; to Cookham, Maidenhead and Twyford stations. Public transport links are vital to so many people living in the local area and the added reassurance that they can travel in safety will encourage more people to leave their car at home and travel by train.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">An end to rogue car clampers in Maidenhead town&nbsp;centre</h1>


<p class="published">31 August 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that wheel clamping on private land is to be banned, bringing an end to the practices of rogue wheel clampers in Maidenhead and the local area. When the ban comes into force anybody clamping or towing a vehicle on private land will face tough penalties, meaning that motorists will no longer fall victim to the unscrupulous tactics operated by many clamping firms &acirc;&#128;&#147; something that has been a particular problem in Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I know from the letters and emails I receive that the actions of rogue clampers have caused a lot of distress to motorists in Maidenhead town centre, and elsewhere in the local area. Nobody should face intimidation or unscrupulous tactics at the hands of clampers. I am therefore delighted that the Government will be able to ban clamping on private land as part of the Freedom Bill, which will be introduced in November.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa asks council to halt extension to work at Grundon Star&nbsp;Works</h1>


<p class="published">10 September 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has asked Wokingham Borough Council to reject a planning application that would allow work at the Grundon Star Works site in Knowl Hill to be extended to 2021. The application has been opposed by local residents, many of whom have suffered disturbances as a result of the landfill work at the site, including high levels of noise pollution, unpleasant odours, and increased levels of traffic on local roads.</p>

	<p>The application would amend two of the conditions placed on work at the site. These conditions currently require the work to be completed by 2016 (for the deposit of waste) and 2018 (for restoration of the site). Under the planning application, this would be extended to 2021, and the restriction on the number of Heavy Goods Vehicle movements related to the importation of waste and soils would also be removed.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Local residents have had to put up with numerous inconveniences as a result of the work at this site. They have done this with the knowledge that the work would at least be completed by 2018. It is therefore extremely unfortunate that Grundon is seeking to extend the time in which work can continue. This will serve to extend the inconvenience suffered by local residents. Coupled with an increase in <span class="caps">HGV</span> movements, local residents will be potentially facing not only a further 11 years of disturbance, but higher levels of disturbance than they have faced at any time in the recent past.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa praises local charities' contribution to the Big&nbsp;Society</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 December 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has praised the role of local charities and voluntary sector groups as part of Berkshire&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Big Society&acirc;&#128;&#153;. Speaking at Age Concern Slough &amp; Berkshire East, Theresa highlighted the important work that local groups did to tackle social problems and improve local communities, and explained why the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Big Society&acirc;&#128;&#153; was central to this.</p>

	<p>In a speech Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;By emphasising the Big Society, rather than the big state, the Government is showing its understanding that the problems facing our country will not simply be solved by a government initiative, or by pulling a lever in Whitehall, but instead will require us to unleash the powers of charities, the voluntary sector, community groups, parents, teachers, social workers &acirc;&#128;&#147; people who everyday are working to improve our society. Here in Berkshire we are blessed with a wide range of outstanding charities and voluntary sector groups, serving all sections of our society and tackling a variety of pressing social problems. I have been fortunate to visit many of them myself.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa encourages Maidenhead residents to have their say on future of the town&nbsp;centre</h1>


<p class="published">23 November 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has encouraged all Maidenhead residents to have their say on important proposals for the future of the town centre, which could shape the character of the local area for generations to come. </p>

	<p>The Maidenhead Town Centre Area Action Plan (<span class="caps">APP</span>) was published by the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and is open to comments from the public until Thursday 25th November. Once the consultation is closed the plan will go to a government inspector for scrutiny.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Theresa has offered her personal support for the plan. In a letter to the Royal Borough, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;As the local Member of Parliament, I regularly hear from Maidenhead residents who are frustrated that the condition of the town centre has failed to improve over recent years&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; I believe the <span class="caps">APP</span> makes sound proposals to make the most of the advantages that Maidenhead currently enjoys and will enjoy in future, including the local waterways, our proximity to London and Heathrow Airport, and the development of Crossrail. Alongside a commitment to work for the overall greening of the town centre, the development of new areas for housing, business and retail can ensure that Maidenhead is a vibrant, pleasant and prosperous town for all its residents.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa also said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I would strongly encourage local residents to look at the plans for themselves and to give their comments. If the proposals are to go forward then we need to show that they have the support of the whole community.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p><em>Full text of Theresa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s letter to the Planning Policy Manager at the Royal Borough</em></p>

	<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>

	<p><em>Maidenhead Town Centre Area Action Plan</em></p>

	<p><em>I am writing to offer my support to the proposals put forward in the Maidenhead Town Centre Area Action Plan (<span class="caps">AAP</span>).</em></p>

	<p><em>The <span class="caps">AAP</span> Submission Document is an important piece of work that will hopefully shape the future of the town centre for generations to come. The proposals contained in it are detailed and constructive, and, should they be implemented, will herald a brighter future for the town. As the local Member of Parliament, I regularly hear from Maidenhead residents who are frustrated that the condition of the town centre has failed to improve over recent years. There is a danger that it will slip behind other similarly sized towns in the South East. The <span class="caps">AAP</span> presents an exciting way forward which can help to ensure that Maidenhead town centre is as attractive to residents and visitors as the countryside that surrounds it.</em></p>

	<p><em>In particular, I believe the <span class="caps">APP</span> makes sound proposals to make the most of the advantages that Maidenhead currently enjoys and will enjoy in future, including the local waterways, our proximity to London and Heathrow Airport, and the development of Crossrail. Alongside a commitment to work for the overall greening of the town centre, the development of new areas for housing, business and retail can ensure that Maidenhead is a vibrant, pleasant and prosperous town for all its residents.</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Keep vital mental health services at St Marks, says&nbsp;Theresa</h1>


<p class="published">29 November 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed her concerns about proposals that could see mental health services for older people removed from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. Under proposals drawn up by Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust, all mental health inpatient facilities could be moved to Prospect Park Hospital in Reading, meaning there would be no services available in Maidenhead or East Berkshire.</p>

	<p>The proposal is one of the options being consulted on by the Trust. A second option, supported by Theresa, would see services for older people remain at St Marks. Currently St Marks offers inpatient services to older people suffering from mental health problems such as dementia. </p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Chief Executive of the Trust, Philippa Slinger, to express her concern about the proposal to move all services to Reading, and to support the proposal to keep services at St Marks.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It would be completely unacceptable for all of these vital mental health services to be moved to Reading, leaving Maidenhead residents with no local facilities. This would mean longer travel for people wishing to visit a relative in hospital, meaning inpatients may well receive fewer visitors. I am particularly concerned that older people may not be able to visit a spouse because of the difficulties they may have in organising transport.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Although none of the options presented by the Healthcare Trust are perfect, it is important that some services remain at St Marks so that East Berkshire residents do not feel abandoned.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa raises constituents' concerns with First Great&nbsp;Western</h1>


<p class="published">21 December 2010</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has held a productive meeting with First Great Western (<span class="caps">FGW</span>) to discuss the train service in the local area. Theresa received an update on recent developments from FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Managing Director, Mark Hopwood, and raised several issues on behalf of local residents including overcrowding on evening services, the electrification of the line from London to Maidenhead and Twyford, and the potential impact of Crossrail.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It was useful for me to again discuss with the Managing Director of <span class="caps">FGW</span> the various issues that are raised by local residents. Although there have been many improvements in the service over recent years, there are still problems to address particularly on peak-time services to and from London. I was pleased to hear that steps are being taken to reduce the problem of overcrowding on these services.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;We also had a discussion about the impact that Crossrail and the electrification of the line will have on services to Maidenhead and Twyford. It is important that local residents do not lose out from these changes, and I will continue to monitor these issues closely.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa speaks up for local residents at travellers&nbsp;inquiry</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 February 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has urged a public inquiry to ensure fair play in the planning system by upholding an enforcement notice against an unauthorised traveller site in Waltham St Lawrence. Appearing before the inquiry in Maidenhead, Theresa highlighted the strong concerns of local residents about the site and pressed the inquiry to support measures to protect the Green Belt. </p>

	<p>The Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead has previously judged that the site on Shurlock Road was unlawfully changed from agricultural to residential use and has ordered all caravans and mobile homes to be removed.</p>

	<p>In her statement, Theresa highlighted concerns that the development of the site constituted an unauthorised breach of the Green Belt and therefore failed to protect the rural area from encroachment. She also raised concerns that the site was on land at a high risk of flooding and that the development had already increased the flood risk in the local area.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is extremely important that planning rules are applied fairly and equally for everyone, including travellers. This is an unauthorised site that is clearly in breach of planning regulations, including those protecting the Green Belt. The council have quite rightly taken action to remove residential dwellings on the site and it is important that the inquiry now upholds that decision to ensure fair play for all in the planning system.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Concern over decision to move mental health services to&nbsp;Reading</h1>


<p class="published">17 February 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has reacted to the news that mental health services for older people are likely to be removed from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. In a blow to local residents, Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust has decided that all mental health inpatient facilities should be located at Prospect Park Hospital in Reading, meaning that the current services at St Marks will close.</p>

	<p>The news follows a public consultation which assessed three different options for mental health facilities in East Berkshire: moving all beds to Reading; keeping beds for older people at St Marks and moving the rest to Reading; and building a new unit in Slough. Theresa held meetings with representatives of the Trust to press for the second option, urging them to keep services for older people in Maidenhead. However, the Trust have announced that they will work on a business case for moving all beds to Reading, signalling that St Marks services will close. A final decision will be made in June 2011.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very disappointed by this decision. I have always said that it would be unacceptable for vital mental health services for older people to be moved to Reading, leaving Maidenhead residents with no local facilities. I am disappointed that the Trust has not decided to keep some facilities at St Marks, particularly since this option would provide the same level of cost savings as moving everything to Reading.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;There are still a few months until a final decision is reached and I will continue putting the case for St Marks. If moving services to Reading is unavoidable then I will be seeking to ensure that it will have the least possible negative impact on Maidenhead residents &acirc;&#128;&#147; and I will be ensuring that the Trust keep their promise to set up a transport scheme for those who need to travel to Reading.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs campaign to keep Charles Ward at St&nbsp;Marks</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 March 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has given her support to the Maidenhead Advertiser&acirc;&#128;&#153;s campaign to save Charles Ward at St Marks Hospital. The campaign follows the news that mental health services for older people &acirc;&#128;&#147; provided by Charles Ward &acirc;&#128;&#147; are likely to be moved from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. The decision by Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust means that all mental health inpatient facilities could be located at Prospect Park Hospital in Reading.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the Maidenhead Advertiser&acirc;&#128;&#153;s campaign and fully support its call for Charles Ward at St Marks to remain open. I have frequently said it would be unacceptable for mental health services for older people to be moved to Reading and I have taken this up directly with the <span class="caps">PCT</span> and the Healthcare Trust. There is still time before a final decision is taken so I would encourage local residents to make their views known on this.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses for action to address train&nbsp;overcrowding</h1>


<p class="published">11 March 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has responded to a Network Rail consultation on the future of rail services in the South East and has continued to press for improvements to services between Maidenhead and Twyford and central London to address overcrowding. The consultation proposes several measures to increase capacity in the Thames Valley region, including better utilising Crossrail when it comes into service.</p>

	<p>In her submission to the <em>London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy</em>, Theresa highlighted the importance of good rail links to local residents and encouraged action to tackle overcrowding. Network Rail have reported that services will need to cater for significantly more people in the Thames Valley area over the next 20 years, and have proposed several methods for meeting this need, including by looking at extending Crossrail to Reading from its current proposed terminus of Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Good train services from Maidenhead and Twyford are vital and it is clear from Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s projections that action needs to be taken to deal not only with overcrowding at the moment, but also with expected future increases in passenger numbers. Increased capacity would ensure a sustainable service for local residents, and I welcome the measures that are going to be looked at, including extending Crossrail to Reading.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is also important that fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford remain so that journey times do not increase.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Pupils from Claires Court Schools have interviewed Theresa as part of the BBC&acirc;&#128;&#153;s School Report challenge. The School Report takes place every year and gives children aged 11 to 14 the chance to make their own news reports on issues of concern to them. Theresa was interviewed by Year 9 pupils from Claires Court Schools, who wanted to know about her work in the constituency as part of their investigation into facilities and opportunities for teenagers in Maidenhead and how this relates to local teenage crime.</p>

	<p>Commenting afterwards, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I was very pleased to be able to take part in the School Report challenge. This is an excellent project which I hope will have encouraged many local children to develop skills and to think about a career in the media. The professionalism of the pupils at Claries Court was very impressive, and it was great to hear directly from them about the issues that they are concerned about.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May is continuing to press Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust over their proposal to move mental health services for older people from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead to Reading.

	<p>In addition, over 2,100 people have signed up to the Maidenhead Advertiser&acirc;&#128;&#153;s campaign to save Charles Ward at St Marks, which houses the mental health services. This strong response shows the level of concern that exists about the move. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said:  &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great to hear that over 2,100 local residents have supported the Advertiser&acirc;&#128;&#153;s campaign to save Charles Ward. I would encourage more people to sign up to show the strength of feeling that exists in favour of services being kept at St Marks. I will be meeting the Chair of Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust to discuss this personally with him, and to impress upon him the opposition that exists to their plan to move services to Reading.

<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is meeting Wokingham Borough Council officials to discuss the provision of primary school places in September amid growing concerns among parents in Twyford and the surrounding area. A number of parents have contacted Theresa to express concern that their children have not been offered places at local primary schools, and Theresa is keen to bring these to the attention of the Council and to discuss what more can be done to ensure that appropriate places are available for all children.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Although the vast majority of parents get their first preference place, there are a small number who miss out, particularly in Twyford where there are real issues about availability. As far as possible we want to ensure that every child has a place at a good, local primary school and I am keen to explore practical solutions to ensure that this can happen. The Council has worked hard to address capacity issues but it may be that there is more that can be done, and there is of course an imminent need to place children for this coming September.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

Several local parents whose children attend these school have contacted Theresa to express their concern about the move, which is opposed by the schools.</p>

	<p>Commenting on this threat to these outstanding local schools, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I do not think that these schools have anything to fear from a ballot of parents so long as the ballot is conducted fairly. I am sure that the majority of local parents will want to support these schools, but I do regret the uncertainty that this is causing.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>&ldquo;I will continue to monitor this and work with other local MPs to ensure that these schools are protected. Our priority should be to increase the number of good school places, not threaten the good schools that already exist.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes another local school becoming an&nbsp;Academy</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 July 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that another local school has converted to Academy status. The Piggott School has followed Lowbrook Primary School to become the second school in the Maidenhead constituency to gain Academy status, which brings with it freedom from local authority control and greater freedoms over the curriculum and finances.</p>

	<p>The Piggott School officially converted to Academy status on 1st July after entering into a Funding Agreement with the Department for Education. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great that another local school has successfully converted to Academy status. This will bring numerous benefits to pupils and teachers and will ensure that the local area maintains high levels of educational achievement. There are now over 700 Academies across the country, the majority of which have converted since this Government came to office. This shows that the Government was absolutely right to open up Academy status to a wide range of schools. I would encourage other local schools to look into this to ensure that standards continue to rise.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Academies form an integral part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s education policy to raise attainment for all children and to bring about sustained improvements to all school. I am delighted that The Piggott School recognises the benefits Academy status will bring.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<h1 class="article">Public meeting to discuss future of Charles&nbsp;Ward</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 July 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local residents to attend a special public meeting to discuss the future of Charles Ward at St Marks Hospital amid a threat to move mental health services for older people to Reading. Members of the public are invited to the Adult Services and Health Overview and Scrutiny Panel meeting on Monday 11th July, where questions will be put to the Chief Executive of Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust which has proposed the move.</p>

	<p>The meeting will take place in Maidenhead Town Hall at 7:30pm. At the meeting the Maidenhead Advertiser will present the Chief Executive, Philippa Slinger, with 2,430 &lsquo;Save Charles Ward&rsquo; campaign forms collected over the last four months from local residents, along with more than 350 signatures on an e-petition collected by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the meeting that will take place on Monday and I hope that many people will attend to show their support for Charles Ward remaining open, and mental health services staying in Maidenhead. It is important to show the strength of local feeling, as many of us know that removing services from Maidenhead would be completely the wrong approach.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes further work on Charles Ward and mental health&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">12 July 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that a decision on the future of mental health services in East Berkshire has been postponed. The decision, due to be taken on 12th July, could have seen Charles Ward at St Marks Hospital closed and services for older people moved to Reading. Following considerable public opposition, <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire East and Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust have agreed to undertake further work before making further proposals.</p>

	<p>The health bodies have stated that they will engage in &acirc;&#128;&#152;a further period of engagement&acirc;&#128;&#153; over the summer following the &acirc;&#128;&#152;significant concerns&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;raised by key stakeholders&acirc;&#128;&#153;. They also noted that no clear consensus had emerged on the way forward. Further work will now be done, and any new proposals will be subject to further consultation in the autumn.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am glad that the concerns of local residents have been heard, and that the proposal to close Charles Ward will not go head for now. In my meetings with local <span class="caps">NHS</span> managers I have always emphasised how strongly these plans were opposed, and that it was unacceptable for older people in Maidenhead and east Berkshire to be left without local mental health services. I am pleased that this has been understood, and that more work will be done to find a better way forward. It is important that work now goes ahead to ensure cost effective and equitable services across Berkshire.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa meets developers to discuss future of Maidenhead town&nbsp;centre</h1>


<p class="published">22 July 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met developers to discuss plans for the Kings Triangle project in Maidenhead town centre. The Kings Triangle redevelopment will transform the area north of Maidenhead Station, between King Street and Queen Street, with new shops, homes and offices. Theresa met <span class="caps">ING</span> Real Estate Developments, who are delivering the plan in partnership with the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, as well as the architects and planning consultants.</p>

	<p>The project, which is currently being consulted on, will see the development of new shops and restaurants with a new &acirc;&#128;&#152;big name&acirc;&#128;&#153; anchor store leading the way. There will also be new homes and offices located above the retail units, with pedestrian streets and links to the High Street, Nicholsons Shopping Centre and New Market.</p>

	<p>Theresa broadly welcomed the proposals but also stressed the importance of this being the first part of wider redevelopment in Maidenhead town centre. She also sought assurances on the amount of parking that will be available, links to the train station, and the likely timetable for the project.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;These are exciting proposals but they are only the first steps in rejuvenating Maidenhead town centre. It is important that the Kings Triangle has good links with the rest of the town centre, and the rail station, so that improvement can spread across the town. I also sought assurances that there would be sufficient car parking spaces and that the flow of traffic around the area would be appropriate for both pedestrians and car users.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Having met the developers, I am encouraged by their vision for Maidenhead and I will work with them and the Royal Borough to ensure that these plans are as strong as possible. I would also encourage all local residents to take a look at the plans and to respond to the consultation ahead of the formal planning permission being submitted.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Local residents are invited to attend the Kings Triangle Public Exhibition at the High Street Methodist Church on Friday 22nd July from 2pm to 7pm, and Saturday 23rd July from 10am to 2pm.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa holds top level meeting on the future of St Marks&nbsp;Hospital</h1>


<p class="published">26 August 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has held a meeting with local <span class="caps">NHS</span> managers to discuss the future of St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. Building on recent successful campaigns &acirc;&#128;&#147; including bringing an urgent care centre to St Marks &acirc;&#128;&#147; Theresa brought together the group to discuss how the hospital can continue to provide good services to local residents, and how future changes to the <span class="caps">NHS</span> in England can strengthen the quality of care and the management of the hospital.</p>

	<p>Attending the meeting were Charles Waddicor (Chief Executive of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire), Philippa Slinger (Chief Executive of Berkshire Healthcare <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust), Julie Burgess (Chief Executive of Heatherwood &amp; Wexham Park Hospitals <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust), Dr Judith Kinder (representing the local GPs&acirc;&#128;&#153; consortium) and Christabel Shawcross (Strategic Director of Adult &amp; Community Services at the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead).</p>

	<p>Among the issues discussed was the future of Charles Ward, which provides mental health services for older people. Recent proposals to move these services to Reading were postponed following opposition from local residents, and new work is now being done on the way forward. Other issues raised by Theresa included the continuation of the urgent care centre, the preparations being made by the various bodies represented for the ending of Primary Care Trusts and the introduction of GP-led commissioning as a result of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s <span class="caps">NHS</span> reforms, and the need for a proper plan for future services at St Marks.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am pleased that I was able to bring together this group so that we could discuss the future of St Marks. What we need is a proper plan for St Marks so people know what services will be available and can have confidence that it will continue to provide much needed local <span class="caps">NHS</span> services.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Each of the <span class="caps">NHS</span> bodies represented, along with the Royal Borough, have an important role to play in ensuring that St Marks continues to improve and offer excellent care to local residents. I am determined to ensure that vital services are safeguarded. With the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s important <span class="caps">NHS</span> reforms coming into effect in the next few years, it is vital that our local health managers are working together in a coordinated way, supporting services at St Marks whilst preparing for GP-led commissioning, which will further strengthen the voice of the local community in shaping our <span class="caps">NHS</span>.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs Maidenhead waterways restoration&nbsp;proposals</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 September 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has backed plans to restore the Maidenhead waterways as part of the ongoing project to rejuvenate Maidenhead town centre. The waterways, which have been neglected for decades, could be returned to their former glory if new proposals are approved to restore York Stream and the Moor Cut &acirc;&#128;&#147; both of which run through the town centre &acirc;&#128;&#147; and in turn link them to each other and the River Thames. When complete, the proposals will see the restored waterways at the heart of the town centre as an attractive feature and a focus for leisure activity.</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in support of a planning application that has been submitted by the Maidenhead Waterways Restoration Group. If approved, the application will allow the first phase of work to go ahead. The restoration of the waterways is an important element of the rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre and was included in the widely-supported Maidenhead Town Centre Area Action Plan (<span class="caps">AAP</span>). </p>

	<p>As the <span class="caps">AAP</span> explains, &acirc;&#128;&#152;although the River Thames flows to the east of the town, a number of side channels branch off before rejoining the main channel. One branch, the York Stream still flows through the town centre, whilst the normally dry Moor Cut passes further east over Town Moor. The evolution of the town centre has disregarded the waterways with adjacent buildings presenting their back elevations or closing it off with high fencing. Our strategy is to improve and reintegrate the waterways into the townscape to enhance the environment and provide a feature around which recreation and leisure activities can be encouraged.&acirc;&#128;&#153;</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The restoration of the waterways is an important part of the wider rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre. That is why I fully support these proposals. We must ensure that we make the most of the natural advantages that could make Maidenhead a more attractive place to live and work. By providing new water features in the town centre, Maidenhead will be better placed to attract business investment and to provide improved leisure opportunities. These proposals have the potential to act as a catalyst for further improvement of the town centre, and their approval will be a powerful statement of confidence in the town&acirc;&#128;&#153;s future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Bring the Olympic torch to Maidenhead, says&nbsp;Theresa</h1>


<p class="published">20 September 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for the Olympic torch to travel through Maidenhead as part of the nationwide torch relay in advance of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Maidenhead was not listed as one of the overnight stops for the relay when the route was announced earlier in the year, but the full details are still being considered by the London Organising Committee (<span class="caps">LOCOG</span>) and additional stops will be announced later in the year. Theresa has urged the Committee to consider bringing the route through Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>In a letter to the <span class="caps">LOCOG</span> Chief Executive, Theresa highlighted the local area&acirc;&#128;&#153;s link to the Games through its close proximity to Dorney Lake, where the rowing events will be held. As a result, Maidenhead is likely to be a key transport hub with many visitors coming to the town. Theresa also highlighted the local area&acirc;&#128;&#153;s reputation as a provider of high-quality sporting facilities, such as the Leander Club and the Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It would be great if the Olympic torch could visit the local area next year, and I want to make sure that the London Organising Committee have considered including Maidenhead on the route. Maidenhead would be an appropriate place for the torch to visit. We are excited to be closely connected with the Games due to our proximity to Dorney Lake, and are looking forward to welcoming many visitors to the town and the surrounding area. Welcoming the torch would be an important means of marking our involvement and building excitement for the start of the Games.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa has also written to local schools to encourage them to get involved in two initiatives connected to the Olympics &acirc;&#128;&#147; the School Games, a national school competition for pupils of all abilities, and the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Get Set&acirc;&#128;&#153; free tickets programme, which will distribute 100,000 free Olympics tickets to children and young people across the country. Many local schools have already signed up for these initiatives, which will encourage young people to get involved with competitive sport. In her letter to local headteachers, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The 2012 Games present a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to inspire a new generation of young people and to highlight the value of competition and physical exercise. I do hope that local schools will be able to take part in these initiatives to ensure that local children and young people are not missing out on opportunities presented by the 2012 Games.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses BT over broadband in local&nbsp;villages</h1>


<p class="published">21 October 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is pressing BT to improve broadband availability in the local villages of Waltham St Lawrence and Fifield in response to continuing frustration from residents unable to access improved internet services. </p>

	<p>Following Theresa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s interventions over recent years there has been an improvement in services to certain areas, particularly in Waltham St Lawrence, but many people are still without good broadband connection. Theresa has again taken up the issue with the Chief Executive of BT to encourage him to look into the problem and ensure that good provision in made in the near future.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;At a time when superfast broadband is increasingly available across the country, and when electronic communication is widely regarded as a basic need in business, I am keen to ensure that no local area is missing out. It is concerning that certain parts of Waltham St Lawrence still seem to be lacking broadband, while residents in Fifield are also lacking certain services. I hope that BT can confirm that these problems are being addressed and that every remaining &acirc;&#128;&#152;not-spot&acirc;&#128;&#153; will be eliminated soon.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa helps local charity to celebrate Healthcare Champion&nbsp;Awards</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 November 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has helped local charity The National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (<span class="caps">NRAS</span>) to celebrate its third Healthcare Champion Awards ceremony by presenting the awards at a special reception held in the State Rooms at the Speaker&acirc;&#128;&#153;s House, House of Commons.</p>

	<p>Theresa, who is Patron of the Maidenhead-based charity, supported calls for further improvements to be made to the quality of care offered to people living with the autoimmune disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). During the event, Theresa spoke to <span class="caps">NRAS</span> Chief Executive, Ailsa Bosworth, about priorities for the sector, including Government proposals to create a Quality Standard for the disease and conduct a new clinical audit to assess how well medical professionals are adhering to best practice.</p>

	<p>The biennial <span class="caps">NRAS</span> Healthcare Champion Awards provides the opportunity to celebrate the dedication and professionalism of those healthcare professionals that go &acirc;&#128;&#152;the extra mile&acirc;&#128;&#153; to provide the best possible outcomes for the many people coping with the disease. This year <span class="caps">NRAS</span> members across the UK were asked to nominate their choices of healthcare professionals for the awards. A wide variety of nominations were received from whole rheumatology units, consultants, specialist nurses and GPs. </p>

	<p>Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The <span class="caps">NRAS</span> Healthcare Champion Awards are a terrific achievement for those working in the rheumatoid arthritis field and I was very pleased to be able to present the awards at the ceremony and to help to raise awareness about this serious autoimmune disease, which is frequently misunderstood by the public. I look forward to working with <span class="caps">NRAS</span> to help campaign for further improvements to the quality of care offered to the 580,000 people in England living with rheumatoid arthritis.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Commenting on the nominations Ailsa Bosworth, Chief Executive of <span class="caps">NRAS</span>, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Once again I am enormously impressed by the dedication of our health professionals in RA and so proud that for the third year, and in such a special year, we are having the opportunity to celebrate the good work of our Healthcare Champions in RA. I would like to thank all those who wrote in with their nominations and applaud our winners for their professionalism and excellent care.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes visit of Olympic Torch to Maidenhead and&nbsp;Bisham</h1>


<p class="published">14 November 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that the Olympic Torch will visit Maidenhead and Bisham as part of the nationwide torch relay ahead of the London Games next year. The torch will travel through the local area on Tuesday 10th July 2012, in between overnight stops in Oxford and Reading. It will first visit Bisham, home of the Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre, before continuing into Maidenhead. The torch will continue onto Slough and Windsor before stopping for the night in Reading.</p>

	<p>Theresa had previously written to the Chief Executive of the London Organising Committee to make the case for the torch relay travelling through Maidenhead and the local area, in recognition of the local links to the 2012 Games.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &ldquo;I am very pleased that the Olympic Torch will be visiting Maidenhead, Bisham and other parts of the Royal Borough next year. This is an appropriate way for the local area&rsquo;s links to the London Games to be recognised. I very much look forward to the relay visiting us next July.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 class="article">No case for services to be removed from St Marks, says&nbsp;Theresa</h1>


<p class="published">18 November 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has responded to an interim report on local <span class="caps">NHS</span> services by reaffirming that there is no case for services to be removed from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. Commenting on a &acirc;&#128;&#152;pre-consultation&acirc;&#128;&#153; report on the future of local health services, Theresa said that any removal of services from St Marks would be &acirc;&#128;&#156;a retrograde step&acirc;&#128;&#157;, and called on <span class="caps">NHS</span> managers to reject the proposals in favour of other options.</p>

	<p>Theresa was reacting to a recent report from <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire and Heatherwood &amp; Wexham Park <span class="caps">NHS</span> Trust as part of their &acirc;&#128;&#152;Shaping the Future&acirc;&#128;&#153; programme. The report follows on from a number of events that have been held in the local area ahead of a formal consultation on the future of local <span class="caps">NHS</span> services, due to begin in February next year. Although the final proposals for consultation have not yet been confirmed, the options currently under consideration include the idea of centralising services at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, which could see certain services removed from St Marks, and Heatherwood Hospital closed. Following the pre-consultation report, the final proposals will be drawn up and put to the public next year.</p>

	<p>In a letter to the Chief Executive of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire, Charles Waddicor, Theresa expressed her opposition to any reduction in services at St Marks. She also highlighted the concern of local residents about the possible closure of Heatherwood Hospital.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have worked constructively with local <span class="caps">NHS</span> bodies and others over recent years to ensure that services at St Marks have been safeguarded and enhanced, and it would therefore be a retrograde step for any services to be removed. With the focus of the work seeming to be on Heatherwood and Wexham Park, I am keen to ensure that services at St Marks are not seen as an afterthought.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It would also be concerning if the potential option of closing Heatherwood Hospital was to result in any reduction in availability of services to my constituents. If this option is to be pursued then it will be necessary for the <span class="caps">NHS</span> Trusts to explain how the spread of services would work to ensure no overall loss of availability.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa supports local residents&acirc;&#128;&#153; plan for Furze Platt Conservation&nbsp;Area</h1>


<p class="published">22 November 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has given her support to proposals to designate a new conservation area in Furze Platt. The plan, which has been drawn up by local residents, would see the &acirc;&#128;&#152;triangle&acirc;&#128;&#153; created by Linden Avenue, Courthouse Road and Furze Platt Road adopted as a conservation area, meaning that its character and identity could be better protected against inappropriate development. Following a recent visit to the site to meet some of the residents behind the plan, Theresa gave the proposal her backing.</p>

	<p>The triangle forms the heart of the historic village of Furze Platt, with many properties dating back to the Victorian era. Although now a part of the Maidenhead suburbs, the area has retained a distinct identity, which would be protected and enhanced through the designation of a conservation area. If approved by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, the proposal would ensure that greater safeguards are in place against developments that threaten the character and appearance of the area. Theresa has written to the Royal Borough to express her support for the plan.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This proposal has been developed by local residents who have taken the initiative in putting it forward. This is an extremely encouraging sign of the Big Society in action and should be welcomed. A conservation area covering the Furze Platt triangle would be an appropriate recognition of its distinct character and independent identity.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is to the overall benefit of the whole local area that individual identities such as that of Furze Platt are maintained, and that links with the area&acirc;&#128;&#153;s history are not lost. Local residents would certainly welcome the additional protections offered by the conservation area status in order to safeguard against inappropriate development in the future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes extra carriages for FGW train&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">23 November 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed an announcement from the Government that additional capacity will be provided on First Great Western (<span class="caps">FGW</span>) train services between London Paddington and Maidenhead and Twyford. The Government has announced the provision of 48 additional carriages, meaning that Thames Valley passengers will benefit from nearly 4,500 additional seats each day on peak services.</p>

	<p>The announcement comes as a result of a Government funding agreement with <span class="caps">FGW</span> that will help tackle capacity issues in the Thames Valley, which features some of the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s busiest rail routes. The extra carriages are planned to come into service in time for the 2012 Olympic Games and will be deployed on morning and evening peak services. The total cost of providing these services will be &Acirc;&pound;28.9 million up to 2013.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The provision of extra carriages is excellent news for Maidenhead and Twyford commuters. It means more seats on peak morning and evening services and will be a major boost to the service. Thames Valley rail services are among the busiest in the country and there is a clear need for additional capacity to ease overcrowding on the trains. I congratulate <span class="caps">FGW</span> and the Government on this agreement, and I hope that it is only the beginning of the action that will be taken to improve train services on this line.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The Minister for Transport, Theresa Villiers, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Adding carriages to some of the busiest routes in the country is a key part of the major programme of rail capacity expansion which we have promised to deliver. This is a vital way to respond to passenger concerns about crowding and provides important support for economic growth.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published"> 2 December 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that two further local schools have converted to Academy status. Cox Green School and Furze Platt Senior School have followed The Piggott School and Lowbrook Primary School to become the next schools in the Maidenhead constituency to gain Academy status, which brings with it freedom from local authority control and greater freedoms over the curriculum and finances.</p>

	<p>Cox Green School and Furze Platt Senior School officially converted to Academy status on 1st December after entering into a Funding Agreement with the Department for Education. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I very much welcome the fact that further local schools will be converting to Academy status. This is a boost to local education and will help ensure that the local area maintains high levels of educational achievement. It is striking that over 1,000 schools across the country have now converted to Academy status. Having recently visited both Cox Green School and Furze Platt Senior School, I am sure that this development will further help them in the excellent work that they are doing.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>Theresa May has given her support to proposals to rejuvenate the Kings Triangle area of Maidenhead town centre. The plans, which were subject to public consultation over the summer, will transform the area between King Street and Queen Street, with new shops, homes and offices. A planning application has now been submitted to the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, which if approved would allow the project to go ahead as the first stage in improving the town centre.</p>

	<p>In offering her support to the plans, Theresa emphasised that the Kings Triangle project should not be seen in isolation and should be considered as part of the wider work of reviving the town centre. </p>

	<p>In a letter to the Royal Borough, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Although Maidenhead enjoys many natural advantages, there is a clear need to improve the town centre if we are to continue to make the most of these advantages. In supporting these proposals, I have been clear that they should not be seen in isolation and must be part of the ongoing work of rejuvenating the town centre. As such, it is important that the Kings Triangle has good links with the rest of the town centre, and the railway station, so that improvement can spread across the town. This development must enhance the town centre, not isolate it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The planning application closes for comments on 15th December, and can be viewed <a href="http://www.rbwm.gov.uk/pam/view.jsp?ID=11%2F03029%2FOUT">here</a></p>

<h1 class="article">Increased investment for local NHS&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">16 December 2011</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed an announcement by the Government that funding to local <span class="caps">NHS</span> services is to be increased. Berkshire Primary Care Trusts (<span class="caps">PCT</span>s) will together see an increase of &Acirc;&pound;35 million in funding for the next financial year as part of a &Acirc;&pound;2.5 billion increase in investment in <span class="caps">NHS</span> services nationally, announced by the Secretary of State for Health this week. </p>

	<p>Despite difficult financial circumstances, Berkshire East <span class="caps">PCT</span> will receive revenue allocations of &Acirc;&pound;601 million for 2012-13, an increase of &Acirc;&pound;16.5 million. Berkshire West <span class="caps">PCT</span> will receive &Acirc;&pound;678 million, an increase of &Acirc;&pound;18.5 million. This is part of a nationwide increase in <span class="caps">NHS</span> funding to local services, which totals &Acirc;&pound;91.6 billion.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The news of increased investment is a welcome boost to local <span class="caps">NHS</span> services. Despite the difficult financial circumstances that the country faces, it is significant that the Government will be providing an additional &Acirc;&pound;35 million for the <span class="caps">NHS</span> in Berkshire. It is important that this increased funding is used effectively to deliver the best possible service for local residents, and that there are proper plans in place for the future of local services including at St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Prime Minister visits Maidenhead to hear from local&nbsp;businesses</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 January 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the visit of Prime Minister David Cameron to Maidenhead. The Prime Minister visited local business Intuit UK and spoke to a number of small business representatives and entrepreneurs. In addition to answering questions from the audience, he used the occasion to announce a range of new Government measures to boost businesses in the UK.</p>

	<p>During the event in Stafferton Way in Maidenhead, Mr Cameron said that the Government would be tackling the compensation culture and freeing small and medium enterprises (<span class="caps">SME</span>s) from the stranglehold of health and safety red tape as part of a series of measures to back enterprise. He also used the occasion to announce that the Government will be asking organisations to bid to manage &Acirc;&pound;1 billion of Government funding available through the Business Finance Partnership, which will help businesses access the finance they need to grow.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very pleased that the Prime Minister chose to come to Maidenhead to meet local businesses and to hear directly from them about the issues affecting the local economy. This was a welcome boost to the town and highlights the fact that so many successful businesses are based in Maidenhead. I am also pleased that the Prime Minister used this occasion to announce a number of new measures to support businesses, which will benefit not only Maidenhead but the whole of the UK.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am determined that we do everything possible to take the brakes off business: cutting taxes; slashing red tape; putting billions into big infrastructure projects; making it much easier for British firms to get out there and trade with the world.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Disappointment at decision to move mental health services to&nbsp;Reading</h1>


<p class="published">24 January 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed her disappointment at a decision to move mental health inpatient services from Charles Ward at St Marks Hospital to Prospect Park Hospital in Reading. <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire approved the decision at a meeting on 24th January, following further consultation work that had been commissioned last year in response to widespread concern about the plan. Although the move will cause concern for Maidenhead and east Berkshire residents, the conditions attached to the decision include the improvement of transport services for relatives and carers, and increased investment in community mental health services.</p>

	<p>The decision follows a public consultation held in 2010 which looked at several options for the future of mental health inpatient services in east Berkshire, including moving all services to Prospect Park. Theresa joined local residents in expressing concern about this plan, which would leave Maidenhead and the surrounding area without mental health inpatient services. Theresa particularly expressed concern about relatives of elderly patients being asked to travel to Reading, and the possibility of patients feeling &acirc;&#128;&#152;abandoned&acirc;&#128;&#153; without regular visits from family members.</p>

	<p>In opposing the plan, Theresa emphasised that were it to go ahead it would need to be accompanied by assurances on transportation for those needing to get to Reading, particularly more vulnerable elderly residents. <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire has confirmed that their decision includes transport support for relatives and carers, and that &Acirc;&pound;100,000 will be provided annually for this.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am disappointed that these important services will no longer be available in Maidenhead. It is important that everyone who needs support is able to access it, either in their home or in hospital. I will therefore be monitoring the situation very closely to ensure that the conditions attached to this decision are not forgotten &acirc;&#128;&#147; particularly that support is available for relatives and carers who will need to make the longer journey to Reading, and that increased investment in community mental health services is provided. I will also be pressing the <span class="caps">PCT</span> on what services will be available at St Marks.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses for answers on support for mental health&nbsp;patients</h1>


<p class="published">30 January 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has pressed <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire for more information on the support that will be available for mental health patients and their families, following a decision to close Charles Ward at St Marks Hospital and move services to Reading. In announcing the decision, <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire agreed to provide more support for community mental health services and also to invest &Acirc;&pound;100,000 in a transport scheme to help families and carers get to Reading. Theresa has now written to the Chief Executive to ask for more detail about when these will be available.</p>

	<p>In her letter, Theresa asked the Chief Executive of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire, Charles Waddicor, to inform her when Charles Ward will close and to guarantee that increased community services and transport support will both be in place when this happens. She also requested more information about the funding that will be available to provide this, and how many people will be affected.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The decision to close Charles Ward will have caused great concern to many local residents. As part of the decision, <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire have made explicit promises to provide more community mental health support when Charles Ward closes, and also to establish a transport scheme to help people who will otherwise find it difficult to get to Reading. There can be no backtracking on this, and both these things must be in place when Charles Ward closes. I am seeking a guarantee that this will be the case, and that sufficient funding is in place.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Copy of letter sent to Charles Waddicor:</p>

	<p><em>Dear Charles,</em></p>

	<p><strong><em>Mental Health Inpatient Services in East Berkshire</em></strong></p>

	<p><em>I was disappointed to hear of the decision reached on 24th January to close Charles Ward and move services to Reading.</em></p>

	<p><em>You will be aware of my strong opposition to this and there is no need for me to go over the arguments again now. However, in helping me to assess the impact of this decision I would be very grateful if the <span class="caps">PCT</span> could provide responses to the following questions:</em></p>

	<p><em>1) When do you anticipate that Charles Ward will close, and can you guarantee that increased community services and transport support will both be in place at this point?</em></p>

	<p><em>2) What additional funding will be provided for community services?</em></p>

	<p><em>3) How many people who might otherwise have accessed Charles Ward would you expect to make use of community services, and how many would you expect to access Prospect Park?</em></p>

	<p><em>4) When will detailed proposals for transport support be brought forward?</em></p>

	<p><em>5) Is the &Acirc;&pound;100,000 for transport support being re-directed from other programmes, and if so which ones?</em></p>

	<p><em>Thank you in advance.</em></p>

	<p><em>Yours sincerely,</em></p>

	<p><em>The Rt Hon Theresa May MP</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa marks 200th anniversary of Charles Dickens&acirc;&#128;&#153;&nbsp;birth</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 February 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens and has paid tribute to the nation&acirc;&#128;&#153;s literary heritage of which he is a part. At a Cabinet meeting this morning, Theresa was presented with a copy of the Dickens classic &acirc;&#128;&#152;Little Dorrit&acirc;&#128;&#153; by the Culture Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who marked the occasion by selecting a Dickens novel for each Cabinet minister.</p>

	<p>Dickens was born on this day in 1812 and the anniversary has been marked with a series of events across the country, including a memorial service in Westminster Abbey.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I was very grateful to receiving a copy of Little Dorrit and I will look forward to reading it shortly. As we mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Dickens&acirc;&#128;&#153; birth, it is right to remember his cultural contribution to the country and to remind ourselves of Britain&acirc;&#128;&#153;s considerable literary heritage. I hope that this anniversary will particularly encourage younger people to pick up a classic novel as it is vital that these great works of literature are passed on to the next generation.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes increase in local&nbsp;apprenticeships</h1>


<p class="published">10 February 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>In National Apprenticeships Week, Theresa May has welcomed a massive increase in the number of people undertaking apprenticeships in the Maidenhead constituency. Following an increase in Government funding, the number of people taking part in apprenticeships in the local area has risen by nearly 40% compared to the last academic year. The increase in Maidenhead is part of a national pattern which has seen the number of people starting an apprenticeship &acirc;&#128;&#147; many of whom will be young people &acirc;&#128;&#147; increase by 177,000 in a single year. </p>

	<p>The increase follows the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to prioritise apprenticeships and provide funding for 250,000 more apprenticeships than had been planned by the previous Government. The Government is offering employers with fewer than 50 employees up to &Acirc;&pound;1,500 for taking on an apprentice aged between 16 and 24. This will support up to 20,000 new apprenticeships in 2012/13. Businesses can also bid for a share of a &Acirc;&pound;250 million fund to boost skills in their workplace, giving employers rather than training providers direct access to funding for training.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s support for apprenticeships has resulted in such a large increase in the number of apprentices in Maidenhead and the local area. Apprenticeships provide outstanding opportunities for people from different backgrounds &acirc;&#128;&#147; and particularly young people &acirc;&#128;&#147; to learn on the job whilst earning a wage. We know that investing in apprenticeships provides massive returns, both for those taking part and for the wider economy. I am sure that the Government will continue to focus on boosting apprenticeships in the coming years.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa calls for local commuters to be at the centre of new rail&nbsp;franchise</h1>


<p class="published">19 March 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for the needs of local commuters to be placed at the heart of a new franchise agreement for the Great Western rail line, due to commence next year. The new franchise will be awarded by the Department for Transport and will determine who is responsible for services on the line for the next fifteen years. Theresa has responded to an official consultation and said that fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford to London Paddington should be a priority, and that greater capacity is needed to cope with the increasing number of people using the trains.</p>

	<p>The current franchise is held by First Great Western and will end in 2013, at which point a new contract will commence between the Department for Transport (DfT) and the new franchisee. Ahead of the official &acirc;&#128;&#152;invitation to tender&acirc;&#128;&#153; being issued, DfT have consulted on what should be included in the new franchise. In her response, Theresa highlighted the importance of fast and semi-fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford and stated that these must remain the priority, even with the development of Crossrail. </p>

	<p>Theresa also supported the prospect of middle-distance fast services beginning at Oxford or Newbury, which would mean less-busy trains serving Maidenhead and Twyford. In addition, she noted the significance of the branch lines serving Furze Platt, Cookham and Wargrave and said that maintaining direct services from these stations to Paddington would be important.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The beginning of a new rail franchise next year is a chance to ensure that further improvements to services are a guaranteed part of the deal. It is vital that capacity continues to increase to cope with the heavy demand, particularly during morning and evening peak times. Fast and semi-fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford must be the priority and I want to ensure that the new franchise agreement has these services at the centre.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs bid for Maidenhead to become &acirc;&#128;&#152;Portas pilot town&acirc;&#128;&#153;</h1>


<p class="published">27 March 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has backed Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s bid to become a &acirc;&#128;&#152;Portas pilot town&acirc;&#128;&#153; which, if successful, could see up to &Acirc;&pound;100,000 of government money invested in the town centre. The bid follows on from an independent review of the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s high streets by retail expert Mary Portas. Following her review, the Government has established a fund to support 12 pilots across the country, focused on areas where local partnerships can come together with innovative ideas about how to transform their local high street. </p>

	<p>Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s bid is being led by the Maidenhead Town Partnership, which brings together local businesses and the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead. Theresa is supporting the bid, which could result in money being invested in a number of local projects aimed at boosting Maidenhead town centre&acirc;&#128;&#153;s social, economic and cultural facilities. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I strongly support this bid and I believe that Maidenhead closely fits in with Mary Portas&acirc;&#128;&#153;s review, which focused on town centres that have a lot of potential for improvement but are currently not making the most of this. Maidenhead town centre has considerable potential to become a social, cultural and economic hub for the local community. Additional funding through the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Portas pilot&acirc;&#128;&#153; scheme would be a big boost and would support the work that is already going on following the Area Action Plan.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published">15 May 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has held a meeting with the Chief Executive of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire to question him about reports that services could be removed from St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead. Theresa met Charles Waddicor to discuss the progress of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Shaping the Future&acirc;&#128;&#153; project, which is considering the future of health services in East Berkshire. Although many different options are being looked at, local residents have been concerned by reports that outpatient services could be removed from St Marks as part of a plan to centralise services at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough.</p>

	<p>At the meeting Mr Waddicor reassured Theresa that <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire did not at present want to close the outpatient services at St Marks, but he also stated that the option would remain on the table.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am somewhat reassured that removing services from St Marks is not currently seen as a favourable option by <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire, but until they completely rule it out I left them in no doubt that I will continue to be on their case and will press them to guarantee that services will be safeguarded.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa discusses local broadband provision with&nbsp;BT</h1>


<p class="published">16 May 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has held a meeting with senior executives at BT to discuss her constituents&acirc;&#128;&#153; concerns about the provision of broadband and super fast broadband in parts of her constituency. A number of constituents in Waltham St Lawrence, Fifield and Hurley have raised issues about their broadband connectivity and Theresa sought assurances from BT that action was being taken to address them. Theresa raised her specific concern about the negative effect on businesses and people working from home that a lack of broadband connectivity has.</p>

	<p>Recognising the lack of capacity at the Twyford exchange, BT have recently increased the number of connections available at the cabinet, meaning more people will be able to gain access to the fibre optic broadband. Part of the problem is the rural nature of the area and it was suggested that Broadband Extension Technology (<span class="caps">BET</span>) can be used to boost poor broadband speeds in areas that are further from the exchange. BT also outlined their plans to roll out fibre based broadband to two thirds of the UK, with the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Broadband Delivery UK (<span class="caps">BDUK</span>) strategy aiming to provide for the remaining third. However, the <span class="caps">BDUK</span> strategy requires Local Authorities to submit plans and undertake tendering before works can start and Theresa will be writing to other Berkshire MPs, Local Authorities and Parish Councils in an attempt to speed up this process locally. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is not right that in the Thames Valley, an area close to London and Heathrow and now considered to be a burgeoning technology hub, we do not have a stable and reliable broadband connection. I am hopeful that the work being undertaken by BT, and the Government through <span class="caps">BDUK</span>, to provide fibre based broadband will improve this situation dramatically and allow business and individuals in my constituency, and the surrounding area, to thrive.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa meets Transport Secretary to discuss impact of Olympics on&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">25 May 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met the Secretary of State for Transport, Justine Greening, to discuss the likely impact of the Olympic and Paralympic Games on transport in and around Maidenhead. With rowing events taking place at nearby Eton Dorney, Maidenhead is likely to be a key transport link and Theresa therefore sought assurances that appropriate measures had been put in place to ensure that the road and rail network will be able to cope with the expected number of visitors.</p>

	<p>The Secretary of State updated Theresa on the latest arrangements. Around 25,000 spectators are expected to visit Eton Dorney each day during the Games, and Maidenhead rail station will be one of the main stations serving the venue with a shuttle bus service linking the station and the rowing site. In addition, park-and-ride facilities will be available from Maidenhead town centre each day that events are on at Eton Dorney. Local roads, including the M4, could be busier during peak hours and residents are encouraged to avoid affected roads if possible. Additional train services will be provided, but stations could be busier both before and after the rowing events.</p>

	<p>Full details of the advice available to local residents is <a href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/travelinaffectedareas/windsor-and-eton.html">available here</a></p>

	<p>In addition, further information is available every Friday from 12-4pm at the London 2012 Information Centre at the Bishop Centre, Bath Road, Taplow.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;We are looking forward to welcoming the Olympic and Paralympic Games to the local area and it is important that the transport arrangements work for the benefit of local residents, businesses and of course the many visitors who will be coming to enjoy the occasion. It was useful for me to discuss these issues with the Transport Secretary and I am pleased that clear arrangements are in place to address the additional demands that will be placed on the transport network. I would encourage local residents to look at the advice that has been published to see if there are any sensible steps they can take during the Games to avoid congestion.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa &acirc;&#128;&#152;cautiously welcomes&acirc;&#128;&#153; NHS Berkshire vision for St&nbsp;Marks</h1>


<p class="published">19 June 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has reacted to a new &acirc;&#128;&#152;Vision document&acirc;&#128;&#153; from <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire explaining their latest thinking about the future of St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead, and about wider healthcare issues in Berkshire. The document comes ahead of a full public consultation, to be launched in the autumn as part of <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Shaping the Future&acirc;&#128;&#153; project. The new document provides reassurances about the importance of St Marks in providing healthcare support, and states that the urgent care centre will remain on site. It also acknowledges the need to enhance access to outpatient and diagnostic provision in Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>The latest proposals from <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire come a month after Theresa met the Chief Executive, Charles Waddicor, to question him about reports that services could be removed from St Marks. Having pressed Mr Waddicor for reassurance about this, Theresa was pleased to note that no reduction in services is proposed in the vision document, which states: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The proposals in this document do not imply significant changes to&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; community hospitals in east Berkshire &acirc;&#128;&#147; except that the aim is to offer a wider range of outpatient and diagnostic services at St Mark&acirc;&#128;&#153;s (Maidenhead) and King Edward <span class="caps">VII</span> (Windsor).&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I cautiously welcome these new proposals from <span class="caps">NHS</span> Berkshire, which provide greater reassurance about the future of services at St Marks. I am pleased that this vision document has noted the importance of St Marks in providing community health services, and that there is a need for outpatient and diagnostic services to be enhanced. It is also welcome that the work of the urgent care centre has been re-affirmed. As we move towards the public consultation, these assurances will need to be expanded to ensure a proper plan is in place for the future of St Marks so that Maidenhead is not overlooked in favour of new developments elsewhere.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes approval for Maidenhead waterways restoration&nbsp;project</h1>


<p class="published">22 June 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the unanimous granting of planning permission for the restoration of the Maidenhead waterways, following a meeting of the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s development control panel. The five-year planning permission allows the restoration plans, which had been submitted by the Maidenhead Waterways Restoration Group and supported by Theresa, to go ahead. The restoration of the waterways is an important element of the rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that the Royal Borough has unanimously approved plans for the restoration of the Maidenhead waterways. As I have previously argued, these proposals have the potential to act as a catalyst for further improvement of the town centre, and their approval will be a powerful statement of confidence in the town&acirc;&#128;&#153;s future. I would like to congratulate the Maidenhead Waterways Restoration Group and all those who have put so much effort into developing these proposals.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa meets BAA to consider impact of Heathrow changes on the Maidenhead&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published">28 June 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met representatives of <span class="caps">BAA</span> to discuss changes to operations at Heathrow Airport that could help to reduce very early morning noise disturbance as well as cutting emissions. The Operational Freedoms trial resumes on 1st July and will allow Heathrow to test a number of operational changes designed to reduce delays and improve the environmental impact of flights. The trials build upon the first phase of the Operational Freedoms programme which ran between November 2011 and February 2012 and allowed a more flexible approach to the operation of different runway modes at the airport. </p>

	<p>The second phase will last until March 2013 and hopes to continue the mostly positive results of the first phase, which saw reductions in the &acirc;&#128;&#152;stacking&acirc;&#128;&#153; of aircraft prior to landing and a consequent reduction in the emissions of pollutants including carbon dioxide. Among the &acirc;&#128;&#152;freedoms&acirc;&#128;&#153; being trialled as part of the second phase are measures allowing Heathrow to reduce the number of flights landing before 5am, in return for a proportionate increase between 5:30am and 6am. This would help reduce the number of very early morning flights which cause the most disturbance to local residents.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is sensible to trial measures that could help to tackle delays at Heathrow and reduce emissions, particularly from planes being &acirc;&#128;&#152;stacked&acirc;&#128;&#153; over local communities while they wait to land. I am also pleased that these measures might result in the very earliest flights being pushed back. It is often the first flight of the day that can cause the greatest disturbance to local residents, so things will be moving in the right direction even if these flights can be delayed by half an hour or so. If local residents notice any changes during the trial period, either for good or bad, then I would encourage them to get in contact with <span class="caps">BAA</span> or with me.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes Government commitment to a western rail link for&nbsp;Heathrow</h1>


<p class="published">13 July 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that it will provide up to &Acirc;&pound;500 million towards a western rail link to Heathrow, which will provide a direct link to the airport from the Thames Valley region. The commitment was announced as part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Draft Aviation Policy Framework, and represents a success for businesses and other organisations who have campaigned for a new western access route to Heathrow in order to ensure quicker transport links for those travelling to the airport from the west.</p>

	<p>The commitment of funding was announced by the Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, subject to a business case and conclusion of agreements with the aviation industry. The service could come into operation as early as 2021, and will typically cut 30 minutes off the journey to Heathrow from the west of England. More details will be published shortly.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is a very welcome announcement. Improved access to Heathrow from the west will be a major boost to local businesses and will further enhance the Thames Valley&acirc;&#128;&#153;s reputation as a place to locate a business in order to take advantage of good transport links. It is imperative that Maidenhead station is included in the new link and I will monitor this closely.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Justine Greening said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This recognises the continued importance of Heathrow as our major international hub. Businesses west of the airport have been calling for this vital investment for many years.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great to see that a number of local people will be representing Team GB at the Olympics and Paralympics.

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes action to tackle local&nbsp;congestion</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 October 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new investment in local infrastructure from the Government, which will see action taken to tackle congestion on local roads. The Government has today announced approval for a &Acirc;&pound;4.2 million scheme to alleviate congestion on the A404 by converting the Bisham roundabout to signalised crossroads. The scheme will be completed by 2015 and will help to reduce the high levels of congestion occurring daily on all four arms of the roundabout.</p>

	<p>The Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, announced the scheme as part of plans to deliver 57 vital road improvements to boost the national economy, reduce congestion and improve safety. The &Acirc;&pound;170 million investment is part of a programme to keep traffic moving on England&acirc;&#128;&#153;s motorways and major A roads. The economic benefit of these 57 schemes is estimated at around &Acirc;&pound;3 billion.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is very welcome news and will help to tackle congestion on the A404 at Bisham, which is a constant source of frustration to local residents. The Government is right to invest in infrastructure and to support our vital transport links.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Patrick McLoughlin said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Keeping traffic moving is vital to securing prosperity. By removing bottlenecks and improving access to local enterprise zones, key international trading ports and communities, these road schemes will help get people to and from work and power the economy. They also have the potential to help deliver more than 300,000 new jobs and 150,000 new homes.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 class="article">Boost for Maidenhead town&nbsp;centre</h1>


<p class="published">23 October 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Enjoy Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153; Town Team has been named by the Government as one of its Town Team Partners, entitling it to increased support and finance. Town Team Partners will receive backing from a multi-million pound support programme to help put key elements of their plans into action as well as an advice and mentoring package.</p>

	<p>In August, the Government asked Members of Parliament to nominate their local Town Teams for the programme and the successful applicants have now been announced. Theresa nominated the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Enjoy Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153; Town Team, which brings together the local authority, local Chamber of Commerce and local businesses and is working to improve Maidenhead town centre by making use of empty shops and bringing more activity to the High Street. As a Town Team Partner they will now receive &Acirc;&pound;10,000 towards this work and will have access to a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management with direct mentoring and visits from a range of retail experts.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very pleased that Maidenhead town centre will benefit from this increased support. Maidenhead has huge potential and, along with our wider work to rejuvenate the town centre, we can be optimistic about the town&acirc;&#128;&#153;s future. It is also a demonstration of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s strong support for the future of town centres across the country.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs plans for new Free School in&nbsp;Holyport</h1>


<p class="published">26 October 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has backed proposals to establish a new Free School in Holyport. The proposals would see Holyport Free School established as a new day and boarding school in the state sector, on the site of the former Holyport Manor Special Educational Needs School. As a Free School, it would be non-selective and independent of the local authority. The school plans to open in September 2014 with a commitment to providing opportunities for pupils of all abilities and backgrounds to succeed.</p>

	<p>A public consultation has now opened, allowing local residents to express their views. Local parents are also able to register an interest in having their child attend the school. The consultation closes on 16th November 2012. Theresa has responded to the consultation and expressed her support for the school opening.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Holyport Free School would be a welcome addition to educational provision in the Maidenhead area. The group behind this proposal have strong experience in education and have put together an impressive plan. I particularly support their commitment to providing the highest academic standards.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is important for people to know that &acirc;&#128;&#147; like all Free Schools &acirc;&#128;&#147; this school would be non-selective and open to children from all backgrounds. Holyport Free School has the potential to make a significant contribution to the quality of local education, and therefore to further improve the life-chances of children and young people in the local area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa urges progress on Kings Triangle&nbsp;project</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 December 2012</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has urged the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead to approve plans to redevelop the Kings Triangle area of Maidenhead town centre, ahead of a crucial planning meeting on 12th December. The meeting will decide whether to grant approval to an outline application submitted by developers, which will transform the area between King Street and Queen Street with new shops, homes and offices.</p>

	<p>The planning application was first submitted in November 2011 and has been subject to public consultation. Theresa has previously supported the proposals, stating that they should not be seen in isolation but are an important part of the wider efforts to rejuvenate Maidenhead town centre. She has now written to the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Development Control Panel to support the application going ahead.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Kings Triangle site is a crucial one for Maidenhead town centre. These plans are a key element of the wider rejuvenation of the town centre that we all want to see. There are undoubtedly details of the plan that will need to be considered further in the future, but the outline application that has been submitted is an important step and is to be welcomed. If the application is turned down then there is a concern that it will further delay much-needed investment in Maidenhead and set back our efforts to regenerate the town centre.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May has reacted to the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to defer planning permission for the Kings Triangle project in Maidenhead town centre. The decision was taken by the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Development Control Panel and means that the project &acirc;&#128;&#147; which would bring new shops, homes and offices to the town centre &acirc;&#128;&#147; will be reconsidered in early 2013.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Kings Triangle site is a crucial one for Maidenhead town centre and I am concerned that a long delay will threaten much-needed investment in the town centre. The developers must now look at the concerns that led to the application not being approved at this time, and I hope that they can work with the Royal Borough to find solutions so that things can move forward in the New Year.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May will be attending a public meeting this week to discuss proposals for a new hospital serving the Maidenhead area. The proposal to build a new hospital at Junction 8/9 of the M4, near Maidenhead, was first put forward by Theresa several years ago and has recently been taken forward by Dr Philip Lee, the MP for Bracknell, who has published a detailed report on how the new hospital could come into being.

<h1 class="article">Infrastructure boost for Maidenhead in Coalition Mid-Term&nbsp;Review</h1>


<p class="published"> 9 January 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Coalition Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Mid-Term Review&acirc;&#128;&#153; which has confirmed the progress of several infrastructure projects that will boost the Maidenhead area. The &acirc;&#128;&#152;Mid-Term Review&acirc;&#128;&#153; document, published by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, confirms the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s commitment to a new western rail link to Heathrow Airport, and the Crossrail project. There will also be a boost in broadband provision, with the Government committing to achieving universal broadband across the UK including in rural areas.</p>

	<p>The &acirc;&#128;&#152;Mid-Term Review&acirc;&#128;&#153; confirms the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s support for:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>western rail link to Heathrow</strong>, which will provide a direct link to the airport from the Thames Valley region and has been supported by businesses and other organisations who have campaigned for a new route in order to ensure quicker transport links for those travelling to from the west. The service will typically cut 30 minutes off the journey to Heathrow from the west of England.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
<strong>Crossrail</strong>, which will come into operation in 2018 and will provide a stopping through-route from Maidenhead to central London and Canary Wharf.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Sir Howard Davies&acirc;&#128;&#153; <strong>Airports Commission</strong>, which will consider the best way of maintaining the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s global aviation hub status and will have a key bearing on the future of Heathrow Airport.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
<strong>Universal broadband</strong> across the UK, including rural areas, at a minimum speed of 2Mbps by 2015.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Two of the key issues that I deal with as a local MP are transport infrastructure and broadband provision. Local residents and businesses need to know that both will continue to improve, and I am therefore delighted that the Government is reiterating its support for these projects. The western rail link to Heathrow, combined with Crossrail, will ensure even better transport links for Maidenhead, while improvements in broadband will be greatly welcomed by local villages. These sort of infrastructure improvements will be a big boost for the Maidenhead area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes commitment to consider electrification of rail services to Furze Platt, Cookham and&nbsp;Wargrave</h1>


<p class="published">14 January 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the publication of Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s new strategic plan, which confirms plans to electrify the Great Western route serving Maidenhead and Twyford, and opens the possibility of extending electrification to the Thames Valley branch lines. The plan follows on from the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that it would provide &Acirc;&pound;14 billion to Network Rail to improve rail infrastructure, and that the Great Western line would be electrified to ensure quicker and cleaner services.</p>

	<p>Network Rail will electrify the line between London and Bristol, including Newbury and Oxford, by 2016 and to Cardiff by 2017. The plan was first announced by the Government in 2010. </p>

	<p>Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s strategic plan for 2014-19 confirms that the electrification of the Thames Valley branch lines &acirc;&#128;&#147; which terminate at Henley-on-Thames and Marlow, and also serve Furze Platt, Cookham and Wargrave &acirc;&#128;&#147; will also be considered. This was called for by Theresa in her response to the Department for Transport&acirc;&#128;&#153;s consultation on the future of the Great Western franchise.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very pleased that Network Rail are considering extending electrification to the Thames Valley branch lines, which are crucial routes serving my constituents in Furze Platt, Cookham and Wargrave. This is something that I have previously called for, and will be important in ensuring that direct services to London are maintained on the branch lines.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Overall, the electrification of the Great Western route is very welcome and will be part of the work that is needed to reduce overcrowding.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Helping households with their council tax&nbsp;bill</h1>


<p class="published">15 January 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the progress being made to reduce monthly council tax bills in the local area. Council tax has been reduced or frozen for everyone in the Maidenhead constituency, and new Government rules will now allow payments to be spread over 12 months rather than 10. This move will lower average band D council tax instalments by an average of &Acirc;&pound;24 per month for 10 months, particularly helping those on fixed incomes such as pensioners. </p>

	<p>The new right to choose to pay in 12 monthly instalments comes into effect from April. Local taxpayers just need to contact their council to request the change. Households can continue to pay in 10 instalments over the year if they wish. This comes on top of Government funding to freeze council tax for the third consecutive year, and the introduction of local referendums to veto high council tax hikes.</p>

	<p>Since the current Government came to office, council tax has fallen by 1.7% in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and has been frozen in Wokingham Borough. The Government has already announced support for local authorities in England to help them freeze council tax in 2014-15 for a third year and assist in keeping bills down. A freeze in council tax in 2013-14 would represent a real terms cut of around two per cent.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;By making it possible for taxpayers to pay over 12 months rather than 10, households will be able to bring down their monthly outgoings. This will be particularly beneficial for pensioners who are on a fixed income. This is a welcome move and comes on top of the progress that has already been made in reducing council tax bills, thanks to the work of our local councillors and funding from central government.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published">31 January 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed her support for Eton College&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that it will be taking on the role of sole educational sponsor of Holyport College, the new free school due to open in September 2014 in her constituency. Holyport College will be established as a new day and boarding school in the state sector, with specific provision being made for looked-after children, children on the edge of care and those from armed forces families. Eton&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sponsorship will be undertaken through the provision of staff time and expertise, and sharing educational experience and facilities.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The partnership between Holyport College and Eton College is one that could bring significant benefits to the local area, and is a promising sign of the kind of collaboration between the state and independent sectors that can be a model for the future. It is great that local children in the state sector will have the chance to benefit from the expertise of Eton College, and I hope that we can see similar partnerships extending across the country.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Tony Little, Head Master of Eton said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;We believe in the vision for Holyport College as a new state boarding school and see its geographical proximity to Eton as a real opportunity. We have a leading role on the Governing Body and will help shape the school ready for opening in September 2014. We look forward to sharing a number of our facilities and activities and developing educational initiatives for the benefit of pupils of both Colleges.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>Education Secretary Michael Gove said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The partnership between Eton College and Holyport College is inspiring. Eton College&rsquo;s heritage of distinguished academic and co-curricular excellence will be of benefit to all Holyport&rsquo;s pupils, and will allow them to enjoy exceptional facilities while attending a Free School. This is an outstanding example of a state-independent education partnership.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa expresses concern about potential increase in night flights over&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">15 March 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed her concern about a proposal to increase the proportion of night flights over the Maidenhead area. The proposal, contained in a consultation document published by the Department for Transport, would see an &acirc;&#128;&#152;easterly preference&acirc;&#128;&#153; scheme introduced for night flights landing at Heathrow Airport. This would mean more flights arriving from the west of the airport, over the Maidenhead area.</p>

	<p>The current system results in around 70% of night flights approaching from the east of Heathrow, with around 30% travelling in an easterly direction over the Thames Valley region. The proposed new system would see this rise to 60% by giving preference to easterly operations, meaning more night flights approaching from the west of the airport.</p>

	<p>Theresa has responded to the consultation to raise concerns about this. Commenting, she said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have campaigned against any increase in night flights, so I am concerned about this proposal. This would represent a major shift and would result in an increase in aircraft arriving at night from the west, over the Maidenhead area.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;This would constitute a dramatic break from the system that has operated since the 1960s, which sees more flights towards the east of Heathrow. I am concerned about the effect this will have on local residents, who could not have anticipated this change when they bought their houses.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes income tax cut for 42,000 people in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">27 March 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed confirmation that over 42,000 people living in the Maidenhead area will benefit from an income tax cut as a result of this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Budget, which announced that the amount people can earn before paying income tax &acirc;&#128;&#147; the personal allowance &acirc;&#128;&#147; will rise to &Acirc;&pound;10,000 in April 2014. People in Maidenhead will be over &Acirc;&pound;700 better off every year compared to 2010. Across the UK, 24 million people will see a tax cut and almost three million more of the lowest paid people will pay no income tax at all. </p>

	<p>The tax cut will benefit an estimated 42,687 people in the Maidenhead constituency. In April 2014, 359 people will be lifted out of income tax, taking the total number of people in Maidenhead lifted out of tax altogether since 2010 to an estimated 4,077. This means that every person paying tax at the previous 10p rate under the last Government will now be paying no income tax at all on that income. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is fantastic that over 42,000 people in the Maidenhead area will benefit from an income tax cut following the Chancellor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Budget. This will be real help for families at a time when household finances are understandably tight. Lower earners will particularly benefit by being taken out of income tax altogether.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses Network Rail on train services for Maidenhead and&nbsp;Twyford</h1>


<p class="published">29 April 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has pressed Network Rail to ensure that Maidenhead and Twyford commuters benefit from improvements to the Great Western route over the coming years. At a recent meeting with senior Network Rail officials Theresa received an update on upcoming improvement works including the electrification of the line, the redevelopment of Maidenhead station, and the introduction of Crossrail. Theresa emphasised the importance of fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford to London Paddington.</p>

	<p>Network Rail confirmed that the electrification of the Great Western line is underway and will allow increased capacity on the line. Work to redevelop Maidenhead station will also go ahead in preparation for the introduction of Crossrail. This will ensure improved accessibility with step-free access to all platforms.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is good to hear that improvement work is progressing, with electrification of the line underway and work to redevelop Maidenhead station on the way. As I have consistently said, fast services from Maidenhead and Twyford must be the priority and these must be at the centre of plans for the future of the line.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa also raised local residents&acirc;&#128;&#153; concerns about new railway bridges being erected in the area &acirc;&#128;&#147; particularly in <strong>Duffield Road in Woodley</strong>, where local residents have expressed disappointment at the &acirc;&#128;&#152;ugly&acirc;&#128;&#153; nature of the new metal bridge which is out of keeping with the surrounding rural area.</p>

	<p>Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I understand that some of the existing bridges need to be replaced in order to make way for electrification of the line, but the new bridges need to be in keeping with the local area and not eyesores like the one in Duffield Road.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa expresses disappointment at rejection of Kings Triangle&nbsp;proposals</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 May 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed disappointment at the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to refuse planning permission for the Kings Triangle project in Maidenhead town centre. The decision was taken by the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Development Control Panel and means that the project &acirc;&#128;&#147; which would bring new shops, homes and offices to the town centre &acirc;&#128;&#147; cannot proceed for the time being. Theresa has previously supported the proposals and called on the council to approve them.</p>

	<p>The planning application was first submitted in November 2011 and has been subject to public consultation. In December 2012, a decision on planning permission was deferred to allow the developers, <span class="caps">ING</span>, to address some issues that were raised. Following this, planning officers from the council recommended that the development should be supported, noting that it &acirc;&#128;&#156;will help bring about the rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre and in particular will enhance the retail offer and create new homes and office space all within a high quality environment that will integrate well into its surroundings.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa has consistently supported the proposals, stating that they should not be seen in isolation but are an important part of the wider efforts to rejuvenate Maidenhead town centre.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is a disappointing decision. This site is an important one for the town centre, and the Kings Triangle project would be part of the wider rejuvenation of Maidenhead that we all want to see. I am concerned at the message this sends to local residents and the business community, who want to see progress made in improving the town centre.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Nevertheless, this is just one part of the work that is underway to improve the town centre. With other developments in the pipeline, and the introduction of Crossrail, we can be confident that Maidenhead will continue to attract investment, meaning more jobs and better services locally.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa calls on Heathrow to rule out White Waltham&nbsp;expansion</h1>


<p class="published"> 9 May 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called on Heathrow bosses to rule out any expansion at White Waltham Airfield, following recent speculation that plans are being drawn up to locate a new airport at the site near Maidenhead. Reports have suggested that Heathrow Airport Holdings have considered proposals for a new four-runway airport at White Waltham as part of their plan for the future of airports around London. Theresa has called on Heathrow&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Chief Executive Officer, Colin Matthews, to rule out any new airport at White Waltham.</p>

	<p>A recent report in <em>Aviation Week</em> revealed that Heathrow Airport Holdings &acirc;&#128;&#156;has been quietly exploring options for future airport configurations and two new locations never previously examined for the siting of a major new airport&acirc;&#128;&#157;, one of which is White Waltham Airfield. A document drawn up for the company suggests building a new four-runway airport at White Waltham as a replacement for Heathrow. </p>

	<p>The plan is reportedly being considered by Heathrow in advance of their official submission to Sir Howard Davies&acirc;&#128;&#153; Airports Commission, which was set up by the Government to recommend options to maintain the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s status as an international aviation hub.</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to Mr Matthews, stating that there would be &acirc;&#128;&#156;disbelief&acirc;&#128;&#157; at the proposal among local residents and calling on him to rule out any plan involving a new airport at White Waltham.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;If true these reports are deeply worrying. Heathrow Airport Holdings should reject this proposal now and put people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s minds at rest. We&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve already been through this in 2003 when the last Government suggested expanding capacity at White Waltham for business travel, and it needs to be ruled out again. The Government rightly set up Sir Howard Davies&acirc;&#128;&#153; Airports Commission to consider sensible options for maintaining the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s hub status. His interim report will be published at the end of 2013 and I will closely monitor his recommendations.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes Heathrow assurances on White&nbsp;Waltham</h1>


<p class="published">29 May 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed assurances from Heathrow Airport Holdings that they will not be pursuing proposals for a new airport at White Waltham Airfield. Recent media reports revealed that proposals for a new four-runway airport at White Waltham were being considered as part of Heathrow&acirc;&#128;&#153;s submission to the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Airports Commission. However, Theresa has now received an assurance that this plan will not be put forward.</p>

	<p>Following the media reports, and in response to local concerns, Theresa wrote to Colin Matthews, Chief Executive Officer of Heathrow Airport Holdings, urging him to rule out any expansion at White Waltham. She has now received a response from Mr Matthews stating, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I can confirm that we will not be proposing plans for a new airport as part of our submission to the Airports Commission&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very pleased that Heathrow have taken this early opportunity to dismiss the idea of building a new airport at White Waltham. This was never going to be a sensible option, but it was worrying that it was even being considered at all. I will continue to monitor this to ensure that the idea does not reappear. More generally, I am hopeful that Sir Howard Davies&acirc;&#128;&#153; Airports Commission will come forward with sensible options for maintaining the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s hub status.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Boost for parents as another free school for the local area is&nbsp;approved</h1>


<p class="published">31 May 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that a new school has been approved for Bray. Bray Free Primary School has been approved by Ministers as one of 102 new free schools to open across England from September 2014 and beyond. Free schools are new state schools opened by groups of parents, teachers or charities. They give parents more choice of school and ensure more children can get a great state education. Bray Free Primary School joins Holyport College as local free schools that have received approval.</p>

	<p>The school plans to open on the site of the former Winbury Preparatory School in Bray in September 2014. It will be a non-fee paying, non-selective, non-denominational, co-educational school. Initially opening in 2014 with 28 in the Reception Year, the school will grow organically to a full capacity of 196 pupils.</p>

	<p>The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has identified a need for more primary school places in Maidenhead in time for September 2014 and has stated that they will be seeking to encourage other potential new free schools in the area.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that Bray Free Primary School has been approved. This is a boost for parents in Bray and will help ensure that we have sufficient primary school places in time for September 2014. Along with Holyport College, it is great that new free schools are going to be opening soon and making use of local sites that otherwise would go unused. The Royal Borough is right to be encouraging more free schools in order to ensure greater choice for parents locally.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs &acirc;&#128;&#152;Let Britain Decide&acirc;&#128;&#153; campaign ahead of historic EU&nbsp;vote</h1>


<p class="published">14 June 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is supporting a new campaign to help secure the first EU referendum in 40 years. The &acirc;&#128;&#152;Let Britain Decide&acirc;&#128;&#153; campaign has been launched by the Prime Minister to encourage people to support a new Bill, which is about to be introduced to Parliament and will pave the way for an In-Out referendum on the EU to be held in 2017 after a full renegotiation. The campaign website <a href="http://www.letbritaindecide.com/">www.LetBritainDecide.com</a> allows people to back the Bill and to urge MPs to support it.</p>

	<p>The EU Referendum Bill will be debated in the House of Commons on 5th July. This Bill would put into law the Prime Minister&acirc;&#128;&#153;s plan to hold an In-Out referendum before the end of 2017, following the negotiation of a better settlement for Britain in the EU. As a Private Member&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Bill, it will require cross-party support to proceed.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It has been nearly 40 years since the British people last had their say on Europe. In that time, much has changed and people feel that the EU is heading in a direction they never signed up to. We therefore need to negotiate a fresh settlement in the EU that is better for Britain &acirc;&#128;&#147; and then put this to the British people in a clear, in-out referendum.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;That is why I will be supporting the EU Referendum Bill on 5th July, which will put into law the Prime Minister&acirc;&#128;&#153;s plan to hold a referendum before the end of 2017. Now it is vital to hear whether the other political parties are also prepared to trust the British public to decide our future relationship with Europe.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Statement on Heatherwood &amp; Wexham Park NHS Foundation&nbsp;Trust</h1>


<p class="published">17 July 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May reacted to the announcement that the health sector regulator Monitor has ordered Heatherwood and Wexham Park <span class="caps">NHS</span> Foundation Trust to draw up a recovery plan to deal with poor care and shortfalls in its A&amp;E capacity, following the Care Quality Commission (<span class="caps">CQC</span>) decision to issue the Trust with a warning notice for breaching one of its essential standards.</p>

	<p>Theresa issued the following statement:</p>

	<p><em>I am very concerned to hear the outcome of the CQC&acirc;&#128;&#153;s unannounced inspection at Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals in May. It is not acceptable that problems have been identified in so many aspects of the Trust&acirc;&#128;&#153;s work, including in areas that patients would consider to be basic requirements of a hospital, such as cleanliness and infection control. Some of the problems identified stem from structural problems going back many years, but some also relate to failures in basic standards of care for which there can be no excuse.</em></p>

	<p><em>Now that the Trust has been placed in special measures, it is important that we see a clear plan to rectify these failings and to reassure patients and local residents. We need to see urgent improvements.</em></p>

	<p><em>Despite these problems, it is important to state that the vast majority of the staff at Heatherwood and Wexham Park are dedicated public servants who care deeply about the health and wellbeing of patients.</em> </p>

	<p><em>This is further evidence of the value of transparency and honesty when it comes to addressing problems in the <span class="caps">NHS</span>. I am pleased that the Government has already announced a new regulatory model working under a new independent Chief Inspector of Hospitals, covering clinical standards, the safety of services and, crucially, whether patients are listened to and treated with dignity and respect.</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes good news for Maidenhead town&nbsp;centre</h1>


<p class="published"> 6 September 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed a series of positive announcements affecting Maidenhead town centre, which have given a major boost to the ongoing rejuvenation work currently in progress. In recent weeks, two major projects &acirc;&#128;&#147; the waterways restoration and the Chapel Arches development &acirc;&#128;&#147; have taken significant steps forward meaning that important improvement to the town centre should be able to go ahead.</p>

	<p>In August, the Maidenhead Waterways Restoration Group&acirc;&#128;&#153;s joint bid with the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead for &Acirc;&pound;1.6 million of funding was approved by the Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership. The funding, providing by the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Growing Places&acirc;&#128;&#153; scheme, will enable construction to begin on the first stage of the waterways restoration in 2014 subject to planning permission.</p>

	<p>The waterways restoration will be complemented by the Chapel Arches development, which was granted planning permission by the Royal Borough on 8th August. The development will provide new apartments and retail space next to the waterways in the town centre. Taken together, the two projects will transform this area of the town and help bring the neglected waterways back into use.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted to see progress being made on these important schemes. Both the waterways restoration and the Chapel Arches development will significantly improve the town centre. It is great that these two projects can work together to bring the Maidenhead waterways back into use and provide a major boost to the town centre. This sends a clear message that Maidenhead is open for business, and I hope we will see more progress in the near future on other proposals such as the Kings Triangle.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa: Bring back the Maidenhead mayoral&nbsp;chain</h1>


<p class="published">18 October 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for the Maidenhead mayoral chain to be reinstated. The chain was taken out of use in 1974 when the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead was formed, and the Windsor mayoral chain was adopted as the official chain for the borough. The chain is worn by the Mayor at official events and represents the authority and dignity of the Mayoralty. Theresa has called for the Maidenhead chain and mace to be reinstated alongside the Windsor ones, so that both can be used.</p>

	<p>The creation of the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead in 1974 resulted in the redundancy of the Maidenhead Mayoral chain and mace, following a decision to adopt the Windsor chain and mace as the official regalia. The Maidenhead regalia were previously used by the Mayor of Maidenhead, a position that was removed with the creation of a new Mayor of the Royal Borough. The Maidenhead regalia are still held by the Royal Borough and can be used by the Mayoress. </p>

	<p>During his recent Mayoralty, Cllr Colin Rayner wore the Maidenhead chain at several events in the town &acirc;&#128;&#147; perhaps the first time that the chain has been worn by a Mayor for several decades. This was well received by Maidenhead residents, and raises the question as to why the Maidenhead regalia cannot be used on an official basis at events in the Royal Borough. </p>

	<p>Theresa believes there is no reason for the Windsor regalia to take precedence and has written to the Leader of the Council, David Burbage, to ask him to consider this.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I think it would be proper for the council to reinstate the Maidenhead chain and mace on an equal basis to the Windsor ones, with the Mayor choosing which to use on which occasion. This would be a symbolic change, demonstrating Windsor and Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s equal status within the Royal Borough. The Maidenhead regalia are of historic importance and it would be greatly welcome if the council could demonstrate that it understands the traditions and history of Maidenhead in this regard.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p><strong>Background Info</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The corporation of Maidenhead (&acirc;&#128;&#152;Maydenheth&acirc;&#128;&#153;) was formed in 1582 following the granting of a charter by Queen Elizabeth I. The corporation operated under a warden.</li>
		<li>In 1604, King James I reaffirmed the charter and recognised the increasing importance of the corporation through the provision of two mace-bearers to go before the warden.</li>
		<li>The role of mayor of Maidenhead is thought to date back to 1685 when King James II raised the town&acirc;&#128;&#153;s warden to the rank of mayor. The first elected mayor of Maidenhead took office following elections in January 1836 as a result of the Municipal Reform Act.</li>
		<li>By the early 20th century, the regalia belonging to the corporation of Maidenhead included a seal, two silver-gilt maces, four bridge masters&acirc;&#128;&#153; staves, two halberds and pikes and the mayor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s chain and robe.</li>

<h1 class="article">Crime down again in the local&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published">25 October 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that crime has fallen once again in the local area. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that over the last three years recorded crime in the Thames Valley area has fallen by 25% &acirc;&#128;&#147; one of the largest falls anywhere in the country. The follows the news that, overall, crime in England and Wales is down by more than 10% since 2010.</p>

	<p>Of the 43 police force areas in England and Wales, only two have seen larger reductions in crime than the Thames Valley since June 2010. Meanwhile, Independent Crime Survey data shows overall crime at its lowest level since records began in 1981. The estimated number of crimes against adults in the year ending June 2013 is down 9 per cent compared with the previous year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s survey.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is excellent news for the local area and shows that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s police reforms are working. I congratulate Thames Valley Police on all their efforts, which have resulted in one of the most significant reductions in crime of any area in the country. This shows that by cutting paperwork and bureaucracy, and allowing police officers to focus directly on tackling crime, we can see real improvements on the frontline.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes support for elderly, homeless and vulnerable people in&nbsp;Twyford</h1>


<p class="published">29 October 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed an initiative from the Twyford branch of Waitrose to support elderly, homeless and vulnerable people this Christmas. Waitrose will help support Christmas lunch events for people who would otherwise be on their own on Christmas Day, and is inviting local groups who are putting on lunches to apply for support. </p>

	<p>The deadline for groups to apply for support is 15th November and can be submitted to the Branch Manager, Steve Peppiatt, via Waitrose Twyford in London Road.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is an excellent initiative and I hope that local charities and community groups will consider applying. It is good to see Waitrose supporting the local community in this way. Christmas can be a particularly difficult time for those who are on their own, and I know that many local groups will be putting on special events this Christmas to help support more vulnerable people.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa supports first ever Small Business&nbsp;Saturday</h1>


<p class="published"> 5 November 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local businesses to get involved in the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s first ever Small Business Saturday, which is taking place on Saturday 7th December. Small Business Saturday is a well-established event in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and has resulted in increased spending in small businesses: last year it generated $5.5 billion in sales. The UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s first Small Business Saturday is a great chance for local small businesses to promote themselves and generate trade.</p>

	<p>The day has been endorsed by the Prime Minister and the major political parties, as well as many local authorities, business organisations and community groups. Across the country, small businesses of all kinds are taking part and are planning special deals for customers, showcase events, joint marketing with local media and much more. There are 4.8 million small businesses in the UK and over 14 million people work in them, so this is a great opportunity to boost the economy and support entrepreneurs and business owners.</p>

	<p>Theresa is encouraging small businesses in Maidenhead and the local area to get involved by visiting <a href="http://www.smallbusinesssaturdayuk.com/">www.smallbusinesssaturdayuk.com</a></p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Small businesses are crucial to our economy and our society. We want to see more small businesses starting up and growing in Maidenhead and the local area. Small Business Saturday is a great idea and I would encourage all local small businesses to get involved. I hope this will be successful in raising the profile of local small businesses and supporting their work &acirc;&#128;&#147; not just on 7th December but for the long term.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes new research to commemorate the centenary of the First World&nbsp;War</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 November 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new research conducted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission which demonstrates there are 62 First World War Commonwealth graves in the Maidenhead constituency. The Commonwealth War Grave Commission carried out the research as part of a programme of activity to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of war in 1914.</p>

	<p>The Commission honours the 1.7 million men and women of the Commonwealth who died in the two world wars and they care for cemeteries and memorials in this country and abroad. Some of the graves are of men and women who died at home as a result of wounding or sickness overseas. In other cases, graves remember those men and women who died on active service while serving on land, at sea, or in the air.</p>

	<p>Research shows the highest concentration of graves are located in Maidenhead Cemetery and All Saints Churchyard, Boyn Hill. Theresa encourages people to visit the graves to mark the centenary of the First World War, and to ensure that they are kept in good condition.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the research carried out by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission which shows there are 62 First World War Commonwealth graves in Maidenhead and the local area. Next year marks the centenary of the First World War and we should respect the graves of the servicemen and women who served during the War. It is important to remember those who served in both of the world wars and this does not just have to be on Remembrance Sunday.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes extension to night flying restrictions at&nbsp;Heathrow</h1>


<p class="published">22 November 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed an announcement from the Department for Transport that restrictions on night flights at Heathrow Airport are to be extended until at least 2017. Restrictions were initially extended until October 2014, and the Department for Transport is now proposing to extend this for a further three years. The proposals will also see further restrictions placed on the noisiest types of aircraft, which will not be able to operate between 11pm and 7am.</p>

	<p>The announcement came as part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s response to a consultation held earlier this year on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Theresa responded to the consultation in order to oppose proposals that would have resulted in more night flights over the Maidenhead area.</p>

	<p>The Government has concluded that it would not be sensible to make any significant changes to the current night flights regime before Sir Howard Davies&acirc;&#128;&#153; independent Airports Commission has completed its work and the Government has had time to consider its recommendations. It therefore proposes to set a three-year regime to last until October 2017 which will retain the main features of the current regime, in particular the numbers of movements and noise quota permitted. </p>

	<p>In addition, the Government is proposing to extend the operational ban on the noisiest types of aircraft to cover the period between 11pm and 7am. This is an extension to the current restrictions, which begin at 11:30pm. This change would prevent sleep disturbance caused by movements of these noisier aircraft types between 11 and 11:30pm.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s proposals to extend the current restrictions on night flights for a further three years. Many local residents would have been concerned about any plans to weaken the restrictions or increase the number of night flights. It is also good that there will be further restrictions on the noisiest aircraft, which should help to reduce the worst incidents of noise disturbance.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa promotes Start-Up Loans for local&nbsp;entrepreneurs</h1>


<p class="published"> 6 December 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local entrepreneurs to take advantage of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Start-Up Loans schemes. The Start-Up Loans scheme is a government-funded initiative that provides start-up support in the form of a repayable loan together with a business mentor for entrepreneurs across the country. So far, 10,000 loans have been awarded to entrepreneurs worth a total of &Acirc;&pound;50 million.</p>

	<p>Start-Up Loans are designed to go some way to help solve the problem of supporting people who have a feasible business idea but no access to finance. With finance and mentoring available to entrepreneurs, the scheme is helping to support small businesses and aims to help 30,000 new businesses by 2015.</p>

	<p>Despite the good progress made, Theresa is keen to see greater take-up in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead. So far, five Start-Up Loans have been made to entrepreneurs in the Royal Borough but this is lower than other local authorities in the South East and in other similarly-sized areas across the country. Theresa has written to the Royal Borough and the Thames Valley Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (<span class="caps">LEP</span>) to encourage greater awareness of the scheme in the local area.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;People wanting to set up a new business can often find it hard to get a loan. We need to support entrepreneurs and small businesses and ensure that good business ideas don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t go to waste. It is great that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Start-Up Loans scheme is supporting so many entrepreneurs across the country, and I hope we can see even greater take-up in Maidenhead to ensure that local people are not missing out.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes business rates help for local&nbsp;companies</h1>


<p class="published">10 December 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that thousands of business properties in Maidenhead and the local area will benefit from a package to help the high street and support businesses, announced in the Chancellor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Autumn Statement last week. 9,000 businesses in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough will benefit from the measures, which include a business rate discount of up to &Acirc;&pound;1,000 for retail premises including shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. </p>

	<p>Measures announced include: 
	</p>
<ul>
		<li>A 2 per cent cap on all business rate increases;</li>
		<li>&Acirc;&pound;1,000 off business rate bills for all retail premises with a rateable value up to &Acirc;&pound;50,000 for 2014/15 and 2015/16. This includes shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants;</li>
		<li>A new reoccupation relief, which will halve the rates bills of businesses taking over premises empty for over a year;</li>
		<li>The doubling of Small Business Rate Relief is being extended to April 2015 and expanded.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This help for the high street is very good news for Maidenhead and the local area. Thousands of local businesses will benefit from this package of support, including the local shops, pubs and cafes that people value on our high streets. This is a major boost to our efforts to rejuvenate Maidenhead town centre as these new measures will help support small businesses and encourage the use of business premises that are currently empty.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa promotes Maidenhead rejuvenation at House of Commons&nbsp;event</h1>


<p class="published">19 December 2013</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has outlined her vision for the future of Maidenhead town centre at a high-level House of Commons event promoting business and development opportunities in the town. The &acirc;&#128;&#152;Transforming Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153; event brought together businesses, developers and local government representatives to discuss plans to rejuvenate the town centre and attract new investment. The event &acirc;&#128;&#147; which took place in the House of Commons&acirc;&#128;&#153; prestigious Churchill Room &acirc;&#128;&#147; was convened by the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and the Partnership for the Rejuvenation of Maidenhead, and hosted by Theresa in her capacity as MP for Maidenhead.</p>

	<p>In her speech to the event, Theresa highlighted Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s unique advantages for businesses and noted the high proportion of technical, communication and IT industries located in the town. While accepting the advancement of out-of-town retail centres and internet shopping, Theresa stated that town centres had a vital role to play at the heart of the community as a centre for social, cultural and retail activities.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This was an important event to encourage London-based companies and others to invest in Maidenhead. It was great to welcome people to the House of Commons so they could hear about all the good work planned for the town. Maidenhead enjoys many advantages as a place to live and work. We want to make the most of this and ensure that the town centre is attracting new businesses and investment.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>&ldquo;There are a number of exciting plans in progress to continue the rejuvenation of the town centre, along with the development of Crossrail. We have a very active business community who are working with the council and others to ensure that we have the right plans in place to take advantage of all that Maidenhead has to offer.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa convenes high level meeting on&nbsp;Crossrail</h1>


<p class="published">13 January 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has held a high level meeting to discuss the progress of Crossrail, its implications for Maidenhead and the possibility of its extension to Twyford and Reading. The meeting was convened by Theresa and Rob Wilson, MP for Reading East, and attended by senior representatives from Crossrail Ltd, Network Rail and First Great Western, who provided an update on the services that Maidenhead commuters can expect once Crossrail comes into operation. </p>

	<p>Theresa reaffirmed her views that Crossrail should be extended to serve Twyford, and that fast and semi-fast mainline services must continue from Maidenhead and Twyford. Both Theresa and Rob Wilson expressed their view that the best long-term approach would be for Crossrail to provide semi-fast services alongside those already offered by <span class="caps">FGW</span>.</p>

	<p>Crossrail is due to come into operation for Maidenhead commuters in 2019 and will provide a direct through-service to central London and beyond. Theresa has long supported the project, but has also stated that there should be no reduction in First Great Western services once Crossrail begins. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It was very useful to get these three organisations together to ensure there is a coordinated approach to the future of train services from Maidenhead. I am sure they were left in no doubt about my view that Crossrail must complement the existing <span class="caps">FGW</span> services, not replace them.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;There are clear benefits to extending Crossrail for my constituents in Twyford. I am pleased that this is being given very serious consideration and I hope that we will hear more about this soon. Ideally, we should see Crossrail offering semi-fast services from Reading to London in addition to those already provided by <span class="caps">FGW</span>. This would have major benefits for the whole Thames Valley region.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published">31 January 2014</p>

	<p>Theresa May has renewed her support for a new Thames bridge in the Sonning area, following recent travel chaos caused by flooding and the closure of Sonning Bridge. Theresa has long supported the idea of a new Thames crossing in order to relieve pressure on Sonning Bridge and to improve local links with Reading and Henley. Theresa has previously called on local councils to support the plan, and has welcomed the renewed focus on this issue following the recent flooding in the local area.</p>

	<p>The closure of Sonning Bridge caused considerable problems for local residents following the recent flooding, but this only exacerbated existing congestion problems caused by the reliance on Sonning Bridge. Theresa has welcomed an upcoming &acirc;&#128;&#152;summit meeting&acirc;&#128;&#153; involving Reading Borough Council, Wokingham Borough Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, Oxfordshire County Council, and local MPs Rob Wilson and John Howell.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have long supported the idea of a new Thames bridge in this area and have previously pressed local councils to support the plan.

	<p>Theresa May has visited Cookham to assess the flooding and speak to local residents affected by it. She was joined by local councillors and officials from the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead, as local residents continue to face the threat of flooding from the Thames caused by the recent rainfall. Cookham is one of several local areas subject to an Environment Agency &acirc;&#128;&#152;Flood Warning&acirc;&#128;&#153; &acirc;&#128;&#147; Sonning, Hurley, Twyford, Wargrave and Bisham are also among the areas affected.</p>

	<p>Theresa has been in regular contact with the Environment Agency and local councils over recent weeks, and has raised individual concerns brought to her attention by constituents. She has pressed all the relevant bodies to ensure that there is a robust response to flooding.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The current scenes of flooding in the local area are extremely concerning. I have been in contact with the Environment Agency and local councils on a regular basis and have raised specific individual incidents brought to my attention by constituents. I will continue to monitor the situation closely. Looking ahead, it is vital that we consider what further steps can be taken to improve flood resilience along the Thames.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I was pleased to visit Cookham to assess the situation first-hand, and to speak to local residents. I appreciate the concerns of residents in Cookham and other areas affected by flooding. I will continue to press the Environment Agency and local councils to take every possible action to prevent flooding and to respond effectively where it occurs.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published"> 7 March 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for Oxfordshire County Council to provide more information to Sonning residents and businesses about the closure of Playhatch Road, following concerns that local people have not been kept up-to-date on developments. Playhatch Road has been closed on the north side of Sonning Bridge as a result of flood damage. The road has been closed by Oxfordshire County Council &acirc;&#128;&#156;for the time being&acirc;&#128;&#157; so that engineers can carry out a detailed inspection.</p>

	<p>Sonning Bridge provides a vital through-route, and the road closure has resulted in traffic congestion and inconvenience for local residents. There is also a concern that local businesses could be hit if fewer people visit Sonning as a result. Some businesses have expressed concern that they were not informed of the Council&acirc;&#128;&#153;s actions. Theresa has now written to the Council to request more information about the road closure, and to ask that Sonning residents and businesses are kept fully up-to-date.</p>

	<p>Theresa has already renewed her call for a new Thames crossing in the Sonning area to relieve pressure on Sonning Bridge.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The closure of Playhatch Road may be a necessary safety precaution, but we need to see better communication with local residents and businesses as it is having a direct impact on them. Oxfordshire County Council must ensure that they keep local people up-to-date, and that action to re-open the road is taken as soon as possible. It is important to emphasise that local businesses are very much open and Sonning is still accessible. This is further evidence of the need for a new Thames crossing in the Sonning area, which I continue to campaign for.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>This will result in around 3,000 more standard class seats a day across the network, providing 16% more capacity during morning peak services.</p>

	<p>The first completed carriages are expected to be running in June 2014. <span class="caps">FGW</span> have also confirmed that they will be looking to bring more trains onto the network in the longer term.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I know that many people have felt that the balance between standard class and first class seats was skewed. It can be very frustrating for commuters to see empty seats in first class when there is overcrowding in standard class. I therefore welcome this announcement as part of FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s work to increase standard class capacity. This will be a boost to Maidenhead and Twyford residents and will help address overcrowding on peak services.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes extension of Crossrail to Twyford and&nbsp;Reading</h1>


<p class="published">27 March 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement that Crossrail services will be extended to Twyford and Reading &acirc;&#128;&#147; something she has campaigned for many years to achieve. The Government has announced that Crossrail services will be extended from 2019, meaning that services will terminate at Reading rather than Maidenhead, and will also serve Twyford Station. Theresa has campaigned for Crossrail services to be extended to Reading to ensure that the benefits of Crossrail are experienced by her constituents in Twyford.</p>

	<p>The announcement follows Theresa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s meeting with Crossrail Ltd, Network Rail and First Great Western earlier this year to discuss how the extension to Reading could work. Theresa has also discussed the issue with the Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, and encouraged him to support the extension.</p>

	<p>The Department for Transport has confirmed that four trains per hour will serve Maidenhead &acirc;&#128;&#147; as originally planned &acirc;&#128;&#147; with two of these services continuing to Reading via Twyford. There will be no change to planned Great Western franchise services, meaning fast and semi-fast services from Twyford and Maidenhead will continue.</p>

	<p>There will also be cost savings due to reduced infrastructure enhancements required at Maidenhead, while only minor works will be required at Twyford and Reading to accommodate Crossrail.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted the Government has confirmed that Crossrail will be extended to Twyford and Reading. This is great news for my constituents in Twyford and is something that I have been campaigning for over many years. This will ensure that the benefits of Crossrail are extended beyond Maidenhead, without in any way harming services from Maidenhead itself.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I have always said that Crossrail is an important addition to local transport links, and that it should complement existing Great Western services. This announcement is an important step and is another example of this Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s support for transport infrastructure in the Thames Valley area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa supports new tax cut to make people more financially&nbsp;secure</h1>


<p class="published">28 March 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed a new tax cut announced in the Budget last week. From April 2015 the personal allowance will rise to &Acirc;&pound;10,500, cutting taxes for 25 million people in the UK, and taking another 290,000 people out of paying income tax altogether. In the Maidenhead constituency, 43,883 people should benefit from the tax cut next year &acirc;&#128;&#147; and 419 more people will be taken out of income tax altogether.</p>

	<p>Rises in the personal allowance since 2010 mean that by April next year a typical basic rate taxpayer will be paying &Acirc;&pound;805 less in tax than they would have been. Since the Government came to office, 3.2 million people taken out of income tax altogether.</p>

	<p>The Budget measures do not result in any additional higher rate taxpayers. The full benefit will be passed on to higher rate taxpayers, meaning everyone earning up to &Acirc;&pound;100,000 will gain equally and will pay less tax because of this tax cut. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that the Chancellor has announced another income tax cut. Over 40,000 people in Maidenhead and the local area will benefit from this announcement, and hundreds will be taken out of the income tax system altogether. This means people keeping more of the money they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve worked hard to earn, giving them and their families more financial security for the future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa responds to Royal Borough Local&nbsp;Plan</h1>


<p class="published">31 March 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has responded to the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Borough Local Plan consultation, which will help set the long-term strategy for managing development and supporting infrastructure in the local area up to 2030. When finalised, the Borough Local Plan will set out what development is required in the Royal Borough and which areas should be protected. Theresa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s response to the consultation emphasised the importance of protecting the Green Belt and making progress on the rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre.</p>

	<p>The Royal Borough has been consulting on the &acirc;&#128;&#152;preferred options&acirc;&#128;&#153; version of the Borough Local Plan, which asks for views on the suitability for development of several areas within the Green Belt and on the edge of settlements.</p>

	<p>In her response to the consultation, Theresa:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Supported the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s overall vision but emphasised that development on <strong>Green Belt</strong> land should only occur in exceptional circumstances;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Stated that the need to <strong>rejuvenate Maidenhead town centre</strong> must be a top priority;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Welcomed support for the <strong>Maidenhead Waterways Project</strong>, and said that this must be considered as a key part of the rejuvenation of the town centre rather than simply a &acirc;&#128;&#152;water management&acirc;&#128;&#153; issue;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Supported proposals for a <strong>new hospital</strong> at Junction 8/9 of the M4, and stated that hospital-led development, rather than housing, should be considered the priority on this site;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Called for robust rules relating to <strong>gypsy and traveller sites</strong>, to avoid a repeat of the current situation at Shurlock Road, where it has not yet been possible to remove an illegal traveller camp despite action being taken by the council over a number of years; and</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Said that inappropriate development in areas at risk of <strong>flooding</strong> should be avoided.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have a strong interest in ensuring that development in the Royal Borough is appropriate for the area and has the support of the local community. There is a clear need to address population growth and provide more houses, but at the same time we must protect what is best about the local area including its Green Belt land, open countryside, nature and wildlife, and historic sites and buildings.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s overall vision and particularly their support for the rejuvenation of Maidenhead town centre. We must ensure that any future development is suitable for the area and that we avoid development on the Green Belt as far as is possible.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa discusses future of Heathrow with Airports Commission&nbsp;chairman</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 April 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met the chairman of the independent Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies, to discuss the future of Heathrow Airport and its impact on Maidenhead and the local area. The Airports Commission was established by the Government in 2012 to examine the need for additional UK airport capacity and present recommendations on how this can be met. Proposals for increasing capacity at Heathrow are being considered by the Commission, and Theresa was therefore keen to meet Sir Howard Davies to discuss the issue and the potential implications for the Maidenhead area.</p>

	<p>The Commission&acirc;&#128;&#153;s interim report, which was published in December 2013, concluded that the UK will need one additional runway in the south-east by 2030 and announced which long-term options it intends to take forward in the second phase of its work. It will consider three options &acirc;&#128;&#147; one involving a new runway at Gatwick, and two involving more capacity at Heathrow (a new runway, and the extension of the existing northern runway). In the second phase of its work, the Commission will undertake detailed analysis and consultation on each of these locations.</p>

	<p>During their meeting, Theresa told Sir Howard that a number of jobs in the Maidenhead area depended on Heathrow Airport, including many local residents who work at the airport itself. She also mentioned the concerns that many local residents have about aircraft noise, particularly at night time, and the need to consider the environmental impacts of any proposals.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It was very useful to meet Sir Horward Davies to discuss the work of the Airports Commission. The future of Heathrow Airport is of vital importance to the Maidenhead area &acirc;&#128;&#147; for local businesses who rely on good transport links, and for local residents concerned about noise and the environment. I look forward to the Commission&acirc;&#128;&#153;s final report being published next year and I will carefully study any proposals that come forward relating to Heathrow.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Sign up to new Child Rescue Alert text&nbsp;scheme</h1>


<p class="published"> 4 June 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has urged people to get behind a new text message service that will send out information appeals as soon as a child is reported missing. The enhanced Child Rescue Alert system will issue alerts via email and text message at the touch of a button when a child has disappeared and their life is at immediate risk. Theresa is urging people to sign up at <a href="http://www.childrescuealert.org.uk/">www.childrescuealert.org.uk</a> to receive these alerts, which will inform people if a child has gone missing in their local area. </p>

	<p>Theresa is also supporting the new Child Abduction Hub, the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s first purpose-built website providing information on dealing with child abduction. To find out more please visit <a href="http://www.childabduction.org.uk/">www.childabduction.org.uk</a> </p>

	<p>These two important new initiatives were launched on Sunday 25th May, International Missing Children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Day.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;These initiatives will offer vital support and protection for missing children and their families. When a child goes missing, it is crucial that as many people as possible are looking for them. The Child Rescue Alert will spread appeals quickly and widely, via text messages and digital billboards, increasing the likelihood of a child being found. I would urge everyone to sign up to this scheme.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Child Abduction Hub will be a key source of information on all types of child abduction &acirc;&#128;&#147; whether it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s committed by a parent, a family friend or a stranger. This will help parents, teachers, and other professionals make common-sense, well informed decisions on how to keep children safe.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes new rules to help secure a fair deal for&nbsp;pubs</h1>


<p class="published"> 9 June 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement of new rules to ensure that tied pubs are given a fair deal by pub companies. A new statutory code will give pub landlords running tied pubs new rights to help them get a fair deal from pub companies. The rules will be enforced by an independent adjudicator with the power to punish pub companies that break them. </p>

	<p>Tied tenants usually have to pay a higher price for beer from the beer company they rent from. This should be balanced out by reduced rents or other benefits &acirc;&#128;&#147; but this has not always been the case, putting some tied pubs at a disadvantage.</p>

	<p>The new rules will address that, meaning that: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Landlords will be able to request a rent review from pub companies if it has been five years or more since the last one.</li>
		<li>Landlords will be given the right to review the information used by pub companies to justify any rent increase.</li>
		<li>Landlords tied to pub companies with 500 or more tied pubs will be able to request an additional rent assessment to show if they are worse off than pubs with no tie.</li>
		<li>Pubs will have the right to decide if they are tied for gaming machines as well.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I very much welcome this action to support tied pubs. I have met with landlords in the local area and they have been clear that these steps are needed to give them peace of mind that they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll be able to get a fair deal on their rent. We have outstanding pubs in the Maidenhead area and they are an important part of local life, at the heart of our communities. I am very pleased that the Government is standing up for hard-working pub landlords.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa calls for action on&nbsp;flooding</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 July 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for action to help prevent further serious incidents of flooding in the local area, and to improve the response to flooding when it occurs. She has taken up a series of proposals and suggestions based on comments received from her constituents, following the flooding that affected the local area during January and February.</p>

	<p>A number of areas were affected by the flooding, including Cookham, Bisham, Hurley, Wargrave, Sonning and Twyford. Theresa contacted local residents who had raised concerns with her to ask about their experiences and for their comments on what could have been done better &acirc;&#128;&#147; both to prevent flooding in the first place and to respond effectively when it occurrs. She received a considerable number of responses, and has now taken up a range of comments and suggestions with the various agencies involved including the Environment Agency, Thames Water and local councils.</p>

	<p>Among the points that Theresa has raised are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The lack of <strong>dredging</strong> along the Thames &acirc;&#128;&#147; Theresa has raised this with the Environment Agency regularly, and has now asked for more information on sites where removing gravel and silt has been identified as having a proven benefit.</li>
		<li>The need for <strong>Thames Water</strong> to develop a long-term plan to deal with flooding on a wider scale, and consider upgrading their existing drainage and pumping stations.</li>
		<li>The need for quicker delivery of <strong>sandbags</strong> in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead.</li>
		<li>The need for clearing of <strong>drains and ditches</strong>, including in Waltham St Lawrence, Fifield and Sonning.</li>
		<li>
<span class="caps">FGW</span> and Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term work to ensure greater flood resilience on the <strong>Great Western train line</strong>.</li>
		<li>Specific proposals to reduce flood risk in areas including <strong>Bisham, Cookham and Hurley.</strong>
</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am very grateful to all the local residents who got in touch with me to pass on their comments and suggestions.

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes major economic boost for Maidenhead and&nbsp;Berkshire</h1>


<p class="published"> 9 July 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement of a major economic boost for Maidenhead and the whole of Berkshire following the publication of the Thames Valley Berkshire Growth Deal, an agreement signed by the Government and the Thames Valley Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (<span class="caps">LEP</span>). The Growth Deal will see &Acirc;&pound;96.9 million invested in Berkshire, with &Acirc;&pound;17 million confirmed in the first year and a further &Acirc;&pound;79.9 million allocated from 2016/17 onwards. The deal will help create up to 17,000 jobs, 10,000 homes and leverage a further &Acirc;&pound;20 million in public and private investment.</p>

	<p>Growth Deals provide funds to <span class="caps">LEP</span>s (partnerships between local authorities and businesses) for projects that benefit the local area and economy. Among the commitments contained in the Growth Deal are measures that will directly benefit the Maidenhead area including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>&Acirc;&pound;6.8 million will be provided for <strong>improvements to Maidenhead Station</strong> in anticipation of Crossrail.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Network Rail will assess the feasibility of <strong>semi-fast Crossrail services</strong> on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and London as part of the Western Route Study, within the rail planning process.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
<strong>Western rail access to Heathrow</strong> &acirc;&#128;&#147; Construction of a new rail link from the Great Western Main Line east of Slough to London Heathrow Airport (Terminal 5) to enhance access to Heathrow airport from Thames Valley and the West.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Thames Valley Berkshire Growth Plan is a major boost for the local area and is part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term plan to spread economic growth across the country. I strongly welcome measures to improve local transport infrastructure, and it is important to see progress on projects such as the improvement of Maidenhead Station, Crossrail, and a new Thames bridge.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This historic deal means real change for people in Berkshire and the Thames Valley with big investments including new funding for transport infrastructure that will improve journeys and connectivity, while opening up areas for new housing, redevelopment and growth.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May has welcomed confirmation that Network Rail will be assessing the feasibility of providing semi-fast Crossrail services, potentially representing another major boost for local commuters. The news follows the announcement earlier this year that Crossrail would be extended to Twyford and Reading from Maidenhead. </p>

	<p>Crossrail is due to come into operation for local commuters in 2019 and will provide a direct through-service to central London and beyond. Theresa has long supported the project and successfully campaigned for it to be extended to Twyford and Reading.

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Although Crossrail is a welcome addition to local transport infrastructure, the benefits to commuters from Maidenhead and Twyford would be even greater if semi-fast services could be provided alongside existing <span class="caps">FGW</span> services.

This is another boost for our local transport infrastructure, following the announcement that Crossrail will be extended to Twyford and Reading.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Lights Out &acirc;&#128;&#147; Marking the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World&nbsp;War</h1>


<p class="published">21 July 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local residents to take part in the Lights Out initiative on Monday 4th August to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. Everyone in the UK is invited to take part in Lights Out by turning off their lights from 10pm to 11pm, or leaving on a single light or candle for a shared moment of reflection on the centenary of the First World War.</p>

	<p>Lights Out&acirc;&#128;&#153;s inspiration stems from the then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey&acirc;&#128;&#153;s famous remark on the eve of the outbreak of the war: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our life-time&acirc;&#128;&#157;. Britain declared war on Germany at 11pm on 4th August 1914.</p>

	<p>Millions of people are expected to participate in Lights Out, and hundreds of local authorities, iconic buildings, national organisations and places of worship will also be getting involved. National landmark buildings including the Houses of Parliament, Eden Project, the Imperial War Museums and Tower Bridge will also turn off their lights. </p>

	<p>The occasion will be marked in Maidenhead in the Town Hall, where the light in the Mayor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Parlour will be illuminated between 10pm and 11pm on 4th August.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The 100th anniversary of the First World War is a key milestone for our country. It is crucial that we commemorate the events of the First World War and continue to consider the effect that it had on this country and across Europe. Lights Out is an important opportunity for us to mark the outbreak of the conflict, and to reflect upon the sacrifices that so many people made serving their country 100 years ago.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Update: Action on&nbsp;flooding</h1>


<p class="published">15 September 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed commitments from key organisations to address flood risk in the local area and to improve the response when flooding occurs. Following the flooding experienced earlier this year, Theresa took up a series of proposals and suggestions based on comments received from her constituents to prevent flooding and to respond more effectively when it occurs. Based on these proposals, Theresa has secured important commitments from bodies including the Environment Agency, Thames Water and local councils.</p>

	<p>The actions being taken include:</p>

	<p><em>The Environment Agency</em>
	</p>
<ul>
		<li>will conduct a <strong>river bed survey</strong> along the Bisham to Marlow stretch of the Thames</li>
		<li>will amend its <strong>Flood Warning system</strong> for Bisham to ensure that properties at early risk of flooding are not missed out (as happened earlier this year)</li>
		<li>is carrying out an initial assessment for flood defence options in <strong>Bisham</strong> in consultation with local residents; and is inspecting flood defences in <strong>South Cookham</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><em>The Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs</em>

<h1 class="article">Helping local families to own their own&nbsp;home</h1>


<p class="published">19 September 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Help to Buy scheme is helping families in the Maidenhead area to achieve their dream of owning their own home.</p>

	<p>In total 281 people have been able to access an affordable mortgage and get on the housing ladder in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough since the scheme began in 2013. </p>

	<p>Overall, over 50,000 people have been able to buy their own home thanks to Help to Buy, with 82 per cent of those helped first-time buyers. 94 per cent of sales have been outside of London and the scheme is supporting responsible lending, with the average price of a house bought about &Acirc;&pound;187,000, well below the national average. </p>

	<p>Help to Buy is also giving builders the confidence to build, with the Equity Loan part of the scheme directly supporting demand for new-build homes. Since the scheme was launched, private sector housebuilding has increased by 34 per cent while house building orders are at their highest since 2003 with workers being taken on at the fastest rate for 17 years.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is important that more people can get an affordable mortgage and get on the housing ladder. The Help to Buy scheme is helping families across the country, including nearly 300 people in the Royal Borough and Wokingham Borough who have been able to buy their own home. This is a vital part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term economic plan to ensure that more people can enjoy security and a better quality of life.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes more support for rape crisis&nbsp;centres</h1>


<p class="published"> 3 October 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement that the Government has achieved its target of opening 15 new rape crisis centres and providing funds for existing rape support services. Since 2011, over &Acirc;&pound;4 million has been provided to rape crisis and support centres in England and Wales, including funding to create 15 new centres such as Trust House Reading, which supports rape survivors in Berkshire.</p>

	<p>In 2008, in her capacity as Shadow Minister for Women, Theresa published the Conservative Party&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Ending Violence Against Women&acirc;&#128;&#153; strategy, which contained a commitment to create 15 new rape crisis centres. On 13th September, the Government announced that two new rape crisis centres will open in Grantham and Crawley, meaning that 15 new rape crisis centres have been or are in the process of being established.</p>

	<p>The Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Violence Against Women and Girls Action Plan&acirc;&#128;&#153; has also seen progress made on police referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service. In addition, the Government has introduced &acirc;&#128;&#152;Clare&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Law&acirc;&#128;&#153; which allows women to check if their partner has a violent history, and has allocated almost &Acirc;&pound;40 million for specialist local domestic and sexual violence support services, including more than 80 independent sexual violence advisers</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Rape crisis centres provide a vital service, helping rape survivors and ensuring that they receive the emotional support they need. I am delighted that the Government has fulfilled its commitment to open 15 new rape crisis centre, including one in Reading. This is a key part of our strategy to tackle domestic and sexual violence and to ensure that we do everything we can to end violence against women.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Unemployment now under 1% in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">17 October 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has reacted to the news that unemployment in the Maidenhead constituency has fallen below 1%. New figures released this week show that the percentage of people claiming unemployment benefit in Maidenhead has fallen to 0.9% &acirc;&#128;&#147; the joint lowest rate since current records began. The figures also show that, overall, the UK has seen the biggest annual fall in unemployment since records began.</p>

	<p>New figures from the Office for National Statistics also show there are more people in work across the UK than ever before, including a record number of women in work. Since 2010, nationally there are 1.7 million more people in work with the security of a pay packet. </p>

	<p>The UK is outperforming all other major advanced economies with the biggest fall in unemployment over the last year in the G7. 542,000 fewer people are claiming Jobseeker&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Allowance meaning more people are getting off benefits and into work. Youth unemployment has fallen by 253,000 over the last year &acirc;&#128;&#147; the largest annual fall since records began.</p>

	<p>In Maidenhead, the number of people claiming Jobseeker&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Allowance is 548 &acirc;&#128;&#147; a fall of 61% since 2010. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great news that unemployment continues to fall across the country, and that it has reduced so dramatically in the Maidenhead area since 2010. This means more people with the security of a job, able to provide for their families. Thanks to the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term economic plan, Maidenhead has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the UK &acirc;&#128;&#147; but we still need to go further to ensure that every person has the chance to earn a wage and fulfil their potential.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Crime falls faster in the Thames Valley area than anywhere&nbsp;else</h1>


<p class="published">20 October 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that crime in the Thames Valley area has fallen faster than in any other part of the country. New figures from the independent Office for National Statistics shows that since 2010 recorded crime in the Thames Valley area has fallen by 30% &acirc;&#128;&#147; the deepest fall in crime of any police force area in England and Wales.</p>

	<p>The latest figures from the independent Crime Survey of England and Wales also show that crime across the country has fallen by more than a fifth in the same period &acirc;&#128;&#147; meaning more than 2.3 million fewer crimes compared to 2010. </p>

	<p>Since 2010, the Government has followed an action plan to tackle crime by freeing the police to fight crime by cutting red tape and scrapping unnecessary targets, giving criminals tougher sentences, giving the police the powers they need to tackle criminals, tackling the root causes of crime, and making the police answer to the community to help drive down crime.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I congratulate Thames Valley Police on their achievement in cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public while making savings. Crime has fallen faster in the Thames Valley area than anywhere else. This is great news for local residents and demonstrates that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s reforms are working: cutting red tape and giving the police just one simple target, to cut crime. Families are safer and more secure because of this.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa seeks assurances on new rail franchise for Maidenhead and&nbsp;Twyford</h1>


<p class="published">27 October 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has written to the Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, to seek assurances about the extension of First Great Western&acirc;&#128;&#153;s rail franchise, which means that they will continue to deliver train services from Maidenhead and Twyford until at least March 2019. The Department for Transport announced last week that it intended to negotiate a &acirc;&#128;&#152;direct award&acirc;&#128;&#153; for the franchise, meaning that FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s contract would be extended rather than being subject to a fresh bidding process.</p>

	<p>The decision will ensure that <span class="caps">FGW</span> will continue to provide commuter services on the Great Western line during the period that the line is being electrified and Crossrail is being introduced. <span class="caps">FGW</span> have stated that this will &acirc;&#128;&#156;ensure stability during a period when a substantial programme of infrastructure upgrades will take place on the network and new trains are introduced.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Transport Secretary to ask for further information on the benefits that have been secured for commuters as part of the new agreement.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The next few years will see important infrastructure projects that will benefit Maidenhead and Twyford commuters, including electrification of the line and the introduction of Crossrail. It makes sense for <span class="caps">FGW</span> to continue to provide services during this time, to ensure continuity and stability.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;However, since there will not be a full bidding process, local residents will want to know what assurances the Department for Transport has received from <span class="caps">FGW</span> regarding the service they will be providing. We need to continue to see progress to cut overcrowding and ensure more reliable and efficient services and I would expect to see clear commitments from <span class="caps">FGW</span> in these areas.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa slams FGW plans to cut Wargrave&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">31 October 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern about reports that First Great Western are planning to reduce train services from Wargrave. As part of proposals to introduce a daily shuttle service between Henley and Twyford, it has been suggested that trains will stop at Wargrave less frequently than at present &acirc;&#128;&#147; meaning Wargrave will receive only an hourly service.</p>

	<p>Local media reports suggest that the proposals emanated from FGW&acirc;&#128;&#153;s discussions with Henley commuters, and that Wargrave residents have not been consulted.</p>

	<p>Wargrave commuters have reacted with alarm to the plans, and many have contacted Theresa to express their concern. Theresa has written to the Managing Director of <span class="caps">FGW</span> to ask him to clarify what plans they have for Wargrave services, and she made clear that no changes should occur that are detrimental to Wargrave commuters.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Yet again it looks like we have to go into battle to protect Wargrave&acirc;&#128;&#153;s train service. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m really concerned about any reduction in services from Wargrave and I am surprised that this proposal has come forward, seemingly without any input from Wargrave commuters. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve asked <span class="caps">FGW</span> to come clean on their plans and have been clear there should be no changes that lead to a worse service for Wargrave commuters.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa backs new school places in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published"> 3 November 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has backed plans for new secondary school places in Maidenhead. Responding to the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s consultation on school places, Theresa emphasised the need for increased secondary school capacity in Maidenhead in order to meet an expected shortfall, and she has encouraged the council to pursue plans for a new school in the town. She also welcomed proposals to consider establishing a &acirc;&#128;&#152;satellite&acirc;&#128;&#153; grammar school site in Maidenhead. </p>

	<p>The Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s consultation notes that there will be an expected shortfall of 100 secondary schools places in Maidenhead by 2020. Furthermore, the majority of locations considered for new dwellings as part of the Borough Local Plan are in the Maidenhead area. In her response, Theresa said that Maidenhead &acirc;&#128;&#147; rather than any other part of the Borough &acirc;&#128;&#147; should be the &acirc;&#128;&#156;clear focus&acirc;&#128;&#157; of work to increase capacity, and that if an entirely new school is to be established then Maidenhead should be the priority for its location.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome the Royal Borough&acirc;&#128;&#153;s consultation and their overall approach to meeting the expected shortfall in places. Maidenhead needs to be the clear focus of this work because of the expected increase in new dwellings in the town. If there is need for a new school then Maidenhead should be considered the priority.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa also welcomed plans to consider the option of a &acirc;&#128;&#152;satellite&acirc;&#128;&#153; grammar school in Maidenhead. This would allow an existing grammar school to expand in response to parental demand &acirc;&#128;&#147; although new selective schools cannot be established under current legislation.</p>

	<p>Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Grammar schools attract considerable support from Maidenhead families. If a good school wishes to expand in line with existing legislation then this must be seriously considered.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Over 2,000 new apprenticeships in Maidenhead since 2010</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 November 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing 530 new apprenticeships were started by people in the Maidenhead area last year &acirc;&#128;&#147; meaning that in total 2,060 new apprenticeships have been started in Maidenhead since 2010. This means more young people getting the skills they need to get on in life. Across England more than 1.9 million apprenticeships have been started since 2010 &acirc;&#128;&#147; with the number of apprenticeships having more than doubled in this Parliament. </p>

	<p>Last week the Prime Minister announced that a future Conservative Government would go even further by making a &Acirc;&pound;1 billion commitment to deliver 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 and end youth unemployment, funded by reducing the maximum amount that can be claimed on benefits from &Acirc;&pound;26,000 to &Acirc;&pound;23,000, and limiting young people&acirc;&#128;&#153;s access to housing benefit. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Over 2,000 young people in the Maidenhead area have started new apprenticeships since 2010, meaning more people getting the skills they need to succeed. This is great news, and we now need to go further by creating more apprenticeships across the country and ending youth unemployment so everyone has the chance of a secure future ahead of them.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses Crossrail on improvements for Maidenhead and&nbsp;Twyford</h1>


<p class="published">14 November 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met the Chief Executive of Crossrail, Andrew Wolstenholme, to receive an update on the progress of the project and to discuss possible developments benefitting Maidenhead and Twyford commuters. Crossrail is due to come into operation from 2017 onwards, with the line serving Maidenhead and Twyford from 2019 &acirc;&#128;&#147; providing a through-route to central London and beyond. </p>

	<p>During the meeting, Theresa reiterated her view that Crossrail should result in greater choice for local commuters and not lead to the reduction of fast and semi-fast <span class="caps">FGW</span> services. She stressed the desirability of Crossrail providing semi-fast services alongside <span class="caps">FGW</span>, to ensure maximum choice and convenience for Maidenhead and Twyford commuters. Network Rail is currently assessing the feasibility of semi-fast Crossrail services, which would cut journey times into Paddington.</p>

	<p>Theresa and Mr Wolstenholme also discussed improvements to Maidenhead Station and the need for sufficient car parking spaces at both Maidenhead and Twyford.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am pleased that Crossrail continues to be on track to reach Maidenhead and Twyford in 2019. It was good to meet the Chief Executive to discuss recent developments, and so I could press the case for semi-fast Crossrail services which will provide even greater benefits for my constituents in Maidenhead and Twyford.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is also important that we use this opportunity to make improvements not just to Maidenhead Station itself but the wider urban realm. Crossrail and the Royal Borough are working together on this and I will continue to monitor the plans. We also need to ensure there are sufficient parking spaces at Twyford Station, where demand is already very high.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Tax cuts to take more Maidenhead residents out of income&nbsp;tax</h1>


<p class="published">18 November 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed plans for further cuts to income tax. The Prime Minister has committed to tax cuts for 30 million people by raising the personal allowance to &Acirc;&pound;12,500 and raising the threshold at which people pay the 40p rate of tax to &Acirc;&pound;50,000 by 2020. New research shows that the proposals would take an estimated 4,880 low-earners out of paying income tax altogether in the Maidenhead constituency, and would mean no one working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage would pay any income tax. </p>

	<p>Across the UK, the personal allowance increase would take one million low-earners out of paying income tax. </p>

	<p>This builds on the action the Government has already taken to cut income tax. The personal allowance has risen to &Acirc;&pound;10,000 since 2010, meaning the typical taxpayer is paying &Acirc;&pound;705 less in income tax, and over three million people have been taken out of income tax altogether. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The best way to make families more secure is to let people keep more of what they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve worked hard to earn. That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s why the Government has been cutting income tax as well as reducing the deficit. Because of the credibility of our long-term economic plan, a future Conservative Government will be able to go further by lifting even more people out of paying income tax and cutting taxes for 30 million people.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes tax cut for&nbsp;businesses</h1>


<p class="published">24 November 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing that nearly 2,000 businesses in the Maidenhead area are benefitting from the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Employment Allowance since its introduction in April, making it easier for businesses to hire staff and create jobs. The Employment Allowance is a reduction in National Insurance Contributions that an employer pays for its employees. </p>

	<p>The allowance is worth up to &Acirc;&pound;2,000 off the National Insurance bill of every employer and is open to businesses, charities and community amateur sports clubs. The allowance means a business could now hire someone on &Acirc;&pound;22,400 a year, or four people working full-time on the minimum wage, and not have to pay any employer National Insurance Contributions. </p>

	<p>Within the first six months of its launch, over 850,000 employers across the country have benefitted from the Employment Allowance &ndash; including an estimated 1,900 in the Maidenhead constituency. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great that nearly 2,000 businesses in the Maidenhead area are benefitting from this tax cut, making it easier for them to hire staff and create jobs. It is crucial that we support job creators and I hope that every local business in Maidenhead will take advantage of this.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes investment in local flood&nbsp;defences</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 December 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the publication of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s six-year programme of investment in flood defences, which contains details of where &Acirc;&pound;2.3 billion of capital funding will be allocated. This is the largest and most ambitious flood and coastal erosion risk management investment programme ever undertaken in England. The Environment Agency has confirmed that the investment programme will include flood defence schemes for Bisham, Twyford, Charvil and the River Loddon.</p>

	<p>The Government will invest &Acirc;&pound;2.3 billion across the six year period, representing a real terms increase of 9% compared with the Spending Review 2010 period. The plan will<br>
deliver improved protection to at least 300,000 homes in England, and help avoid more than &Acirc;&pound;30 billion in economic damages including a &Acirc;&pound;1.5 billion reduction in potential losses for the farming sector. Overall it will reduce flood risk by 5% compared to current levels by 2021.</p>

	<p>In the Maidenhead constituency, the following projects will be supported:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Bisham Flood Alleviation to better protect 95 households</li>
		<li>Twyford Flood Mitigation to better protect 25 households</li>
		<li>Charvil Flood Alleviation to better protect 35 households</li>
		<li>River Loddon Soft Engineering to better protect 110 households</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term programme of investment in flood defences is an important step forward in reducing the risk of flooding across England. I welcome the commitment made to support projects in Bisham, Twyford, Charvil and along the River Loddon. This will ensure that over 250 local households are better protected from flooding. Combined with the action being taken by other bodies such as our local councils, this will ensure that we are better prepared than ever for flooding.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa discusses timetable changes with&nbsp;FGW</h1>


<p class="published">17 December 2014</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met the Managing Director of First Great Western, Mark Hopwood, to discuss proposed changes to train timetables, including those on the Henley branch line that have caused concern to Wargrave commuters. As part of the proposals, <span class="caps">FGW</span> have suggested that off-peak trains will stop at Wargrave less frequently than at present, although there will be improvements to evening services. Wargrave commuters reacted with alarm to the plans and felt that they had not been properly consulted.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">FGW</span> have drawn up plans to reduce Wargrave services from every 45 minutes to every 60 minutes throughout much of the off-peak period, in order to allow a half-hourly service from Twyford to Henley. However, there will also be faster and more frequent evening services from London to Wargrave due to faster connecting services.</p>

	<p>During the meeting, Theresa expressed concern that Wargrave commuters had not initially been involved in drawing up the plans, and emphasised that Wargrave should not be overlooked in favour of Henley residents. She welcomed the establishment of a Wargrave Users Group and encouraged <span class="caps">FGW</span> to engage with them directly. A formal consultation is likely to be held next year before any changes go ahead.</p>

However, I am pleased that <span class="caps">FGW</span> will now be engaging directly with Wargrave commuters and I hope we can find sensible improvements to the timetable that will benefit all passengers.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses for increase in fast train&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">12 January 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has called for more action to boost train services from Maidenhead and Twyford. Responding to a Network Rail consultation on the future of the Great Western line, Theresa called for an increase in fast and semi-fast services to and from London Paddington to reflect commuters&acirc;&#128;&#153; working patterns. She also reiterated her support for semi-fast Crossrail services and Western Rail Access to Heathrow.</p>

	<p>Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s &acirc;&#128;&#152;Western Route Study&acirc;&#128;&#153; consultation sets out the strategic vision for the next 30 years of the rail network. In her submission to the consultation, Theresa stated that there should be no reduction in Great Western services, and she pressed Network Rail to look at increasing the number of fast and semi-fast services beyond the current peak periods in response to modern patterns of work, with more people making use of flexible working arrangements. </p>

	<p>Theresa also welcomed Network Rail&acirc;&#128;&#153;s commitment to assess the feasibility of semi-fast Crossrail services to cut the time between Maidenhead and Paddington. She stated that the best long-term approach would be for Crossrail to provide semi-fast services alongside those already offered by First Great Western in order to enhance choice for commuters</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;With people making more use of flexible working arrangements, there is a need for more fast and semi-fast services beyond the current peak periods &acirc;&#128;&#147; this means services throughout the day to ensure that the timetable keeps pace with modern patterns of work.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>As of 30th June 2014, every employee has the right to request flexible working. Previously, the right had only been available for carers or people who look after children. Over 140,000 people are expected to make use of flexible working arrangements every year, with businesses benefitting by &Acirc;&pound;55.8 million per year. </p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes another fall in&nbsp;crime</h1>


<p class="published">27 January 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that crime has fallen again across the country and in the Maidenhead area. The latest figures from the independent Office for National Statistics show that since 2010 recorded crime in the Thames Valley police force area has fallen by 32%. This is the deepest fall in crime of any police force area in England and Wales. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, crime measured by the independent Crime Survey has fallen across England and Wales by 25% since 2010 &acirc;&#128;&#147; meaning crime is now at its lowest level since 1981.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;These are welcome figures and show that the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s reforms are working. Crime is continuing to fall in the Thames Valley area, where we have seen the greatest reduction in crime of any police force area in the country. This means Maidenhead families are safer and more secure than ever. I congratulate Thames Valley Police on all that they are doing, and particularly thank all the police officers who are doing so much to cut crime locally.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>The Government is tackling crime by:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Freeing the police to fight crime by cutting red tape and scrapping unnecessary targets</li>
		<li>Giving criminals tougher sentences so communities are protected and justice is done</li>
		<li>Giving the police the powers they need to tackle criminals, using the latest tools and techniques</li>
		<li>Stopping people from becoming criminals by tackling the root causes of crime</li>
		<li>Making the police answer to the community to help drive down crime</li>

<h1 class="article">More funding to support businesses and broadband in the Maidenhead&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published"> 2 February 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement of additional funding to support businesses and infrastructure in the Maidenhead area. The additional funding will support a range of projects, including the accelerated provision of broadband services in rural areas through Superfast Berkshire &acirc;&#128;&#147; increasing broadband coverage to 95% across all districts in the Thames Valley Berkshire area and supporting enterprise in rural areas.</p>

	<p>Thames Valley Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (<span class="caps">LEP</span>) has been allocated an additional &Acirc;&pound;10.2 million by the Government, bringing its total allocation of funding to &Acirc;&pound;107.1 million. In July 2014, the Government announced &Acirc;&pound;96.9 million of funding for Thames Valley Berkshire <span class="caps">LEP</span> as part of the Growth Deal, which contained commitments including commitments to improve Maidenhead Station, introduce Western Rail Access to Heathrow, study the feasibility of semi-fast Crossrail services, and assist plans for a new Thames bridge.</p>

	<p>Growth Deals bring together government funding for investment in infrastructure, housing, and other projects and put it in a single pot, which is placed in the hands of local authorities and businesses to invest &acirc;&#128;&#147; because they are best placed to know how to deliver local jobs and growth.</p>

	<p>The additional investment of &Acirc;&pound;10.2 million means that, from 2015 to 2021, up to 20,000 new jobs could be created, 12,000 new homes built, with the potential the generate &Acirc;&pound;40 million in public and private investment.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This additional funding is another boost for Berkshire as part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term economic plan. Increased support for Superfast Berkshire is particularly welcome and will help accelerate the roll out of this crucial scheme to increase broadband provision in the Maidenhead area. This is vital for businesses and residents, particularly in rural areas.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes more young people in Maidenhead studying core academic&nbsp;subjects</h1>


<p class="published"> 9 February 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that more students in the Maidenhead area are studying the core academic subjects which will help them to get the best start in life. New figures show that the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) is encouraging more young people in the local area to study core academic subjects. The new EBacc is awarded when students achieve A* to C in five core <span class="caps">GCSE</span> subjects including English, Maths, Science, Humanities and Languages &acirc;&#128;&#147; the courses that universities and employers value the most. </p>

	<p>There has been a 50% increase in students in the Maidenhead constituency taking a <span class="caps">GCSE</span> in these subjects compared to 2010, meaning they are gaining the skills they need to get a good job or go on to further study. </p>

	<p>The EBacc is part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s commitment to deliver the best schools and skills for young people. By encouraging schools to enrol pupils for <span class="caps">GCSE</span>s in these core academic subjects, and restoring rigour to the National Curriculum, the Government is raising standards and making <span class="caps">GCSE</span>s more ambitious, putting them on a par with the best in the world and preparing our pupils for life in modern Britain. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is great that there has been a 50% increase in students studying the core academic subjects that universities and employers value the most. The Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s actions to drive up standards in schools are having a positive effect in Maidenhead. We need good quality, rigorous exams to help students gain the skills they need to succeed. This is crucial to giving young people the best start in life and ensuring that they are not held back by low expectations.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">More homes on redundant government land in Wokingham&nbsp;Borough</h1>


<p class="published"> 6 March 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing that efforts to get redundant and surplus public sector land brought back into use will help to deliver 2,000 new homes in Wokingham Borough. Across the country enough surplus public sector land has now been sold off to allow the building of over 100,000 new, good quality homes. </p>

	<p>These are brownfield sites that were derelict and run-down, meaning that redeveloping these sites will improve the local area and create new jobs and opportunities in the construction industry. </p>

	<p>This is just the beginning, with plans to release enough surplus and redundant land over the next five years to build a further 150,000 new homes. This is part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s long-term economic plan that is getting Britain building again, with more homes now being built than at any time since 2007. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Selling off surplus and redundant public sector land gives us the chance to build new homes on brownfield sites in the local area. This is a key part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s plan to increase home ownership by delivering more good quality, affordable homes. There is now an opportunity to build 2,000 new homes in Wokingham Borough and I urge the Council to work with local communities to develop these sites in an appropriate way, ensuring that we keep the character of this part of Berkshire.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes another new school for&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">10 March 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that Forest Bridge School, a new school for children with autism, will be opening in Maidenhead in September after a funding agreement was reached with the Department for Education. The agreement comes at the same time as a deal was reached with Berkshire College of Agriculture ensuring that the school will have a new long-term site on the <span class="caps">BCA</span> campus in Maidenhead. </p>

	<p>The school is opening as part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s free school programme, and will be an all-through school for pupils aged 4-16 with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The school will open in temporary accommodation for two years at the former site of Oldfield Primary School in September 2015, and is expected to move into a new permanent building at <span class="caps">BCA</span> in 2017.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that Forest Bridge School will be opening in Maidenhead having secured a funding agreement with the Department for Education. This is fantastic news for parents across the local area who have children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. It is important to have a local school specialising in providing education to children on the Autism Spectrum, who have particular needs that might not be met in a mainstream school.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

	<p>The news comes in the same week that the Prime Minister announced 49 new free schools across the country, bringing the total number of open and approved free schools to more than 400, creating around 230,000 new school places. &acirc;&#128;&ordf;Free schools are set up by teachers, parents and community groups and tend to raise the performance of those around them. More than 40,000 pupils are already attending free schools and over two-thirds of these free schools are already rated good or outstanding. &acirc;&#128;&not;&acirc;&#128;&not;</p>

	<p>The Prime Minister also announced that the next Conservative Government will go further and open 500 more new free schools, meaning 270,000 new good school places.</p>

	<p>Theresa said: <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Maidenhead is already benefitting from the introduction of free schools, and it is very welcome news that more free schools will be created under a Conservative government. We need more good school places in the local area to ensure greater choice for parents, and free schools have an important role to play.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes support for defibrillators following local&nbsp;campaign</h1>


<p class="published">20 March 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that it will provide &Acirc;&pound;1 million to help buy defibrillators for use in public places including schools. The policy was announced by the Chancellor in his Budget and follows a local campaign launched by Woodley resident Claire Page following the tragic death of her daughter Lilly-May from Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome in 2014.</p>

	<p>The Chancellor confirmed that he would set aside &Acirc;&pound;1 million to incentivise the purchase of defibrillators for public places, including schools, and support training in their use to save more lives. This will be funded by fines paid by banks following the <span class="caps">LIBOR</span> scandal.</p>

	<p>Theresa is supporting Claire Page&acirc;&#128;&#153;s efforts to ensure that every school has a defibrillator installed so that this essential equipment is in place should any child suffer from sudden cardiac arrest. This is in memory of 5 year old Lilly-May Page, who sadly passed away last year.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that &Acirc;&pound;1 million is being provided to help buy defibrillators for public places including schools. This money will also help ensure more people are trained in how to use a defibrillator. This will help save lives and I pay tribute to Claire Page who has been campaigning for defibrillators in schools since Lilly-May&acirc;&#128;&#153;s tragic death last year.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">More local families able to buy their own home thanks to Help to&nbsp;Buy</h1>


<p class="published">23 March 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has hailed the success of the Help to Buy scheme after new figures showed that over 350 local families had received assistance in buying a new home since it was created. Help to Buy is the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s flagship housing scheme to help people access an affordable mortgage with a small deposit.</p>

	<p>New figures show that since the scheme was created in 2013, 367 sales have taken place in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough under the Equity Loan, Mortgage Guarantee and New Buy parts of Help to Buy. Across the country, Help to Buy has now enabled nearly 90,000 families to buy their own home with over 80 per cent of sales going to first-time buyers. </p>

	<p>The news comes at the same time as the Prime Minister has committed the next Conservative Government to delivering 200,000 new Starter Homes by 2020 &acirc;&#128;&#147; good quality homes that will be sold at 20 per cent below the market price and be reserved for first-time buyers only under the age of 40. </p>

	<p>House building is now at its highest level since 2007, meaning more people are able to find a home of their own. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Thanks to Help to Buy, thousands of people across the country &acirc;&#128;&#147; and over 350 people locally &acirc;&#128;&#147; have been able to buy their own home and have greater confidence about their family&acirc;&#128;&#153;s financial security. Home ownership should be a realistic goal for everyone who works hard in life. Every additional family that is able to get on the housing ladder is one more family able to enjoy the security and peace of mind that comes from owning your own home.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Earlier flood protection for the local&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published">24 March 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Charvil is among the areas benefiting from the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement that it is bringing forward more than &Acirc;&pound;140 million of the &Acirc;&pound;2.3 billion six-year flood defence programme announced in December. 47 brand new schemes have been given the green light as part of the long-term investment programme and work will start on another 165 flood defence projects earlier than previously announced. Overall, more than 31,000 homes and businesses across the country will be better protected from flooding sooner than planned.</p>

	<p>The Government announced its six-year programme of investment in flood defences in December &acirc;&#128;&#147; the largest and most ambitious flood and coastal erosion risk management investment programme ever undertaken in England. Flood defence schemes for Bisham, Twyford, Charvil and the River Loddon were included.</p>

	<p>As part of the recent Budget, the Government has now confirmed that a number of schemes will be brought forward including the Charvil Flood Alleviation Scheme which is being introduced two years earlier than expected and will benefit over 30 households at risk of flooding.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is confirmation of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s pledge to better protect homes and businesses from the risk of flooding. I welcome the fact that the Charvil Flood Alleviation Scheme will be brought forward by two years, which is very good news for local residents. This should also provide reassurance to residents in Bisham, Twyford and elsewhere of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s commitment to deliver the funding it has promised.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa expresses concern about Council&acirc;&#128;&#153;s action against Hare Hatch&nbsp;Sheeplands</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 April 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern about Wokingham Borough Council&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to refuse a &acirc;&#128;&#152;certificate application for lawful use&acirc;&#128;&#153; for the Hare Hatch Sheeplands garden centre in Twyford. Hare Hatch Sheeplands is a popular garden centre and employs many people in the Twyford area. It has been in discussions with Wokingham Borough Council for some time regarding planning permission for several buildings on the site. The decision announced by the Council yesterday appears to bring to an end the chances of an agreement with the garden centre, and threatens its ability to remain open.</p>

	<p>Many local residents have voiced their support for Hare Hatch Sheeplands and stated their concerns that enforcement action against it will result in a valued business being forced to close, with the consequent loss of jobs. Theresa has been seeking a compromise agreement between the Council and Hare Hatch Sheeplands. An agreement appeared to have been reached in April 2014 but yesterday&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement seems to mark the end of any negotiations, meaning that the Council will proceed with enforcement action.</p>

	<p>Theresa also expressed concern about the timing of the announcement, which came on the day after the dissolution of Parliament.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Hare Hatch Sheeplands is a greatly valued local garden centre and it is very disappointing that an agreement has not been found to avoid this enforcement action against it. I have consistently urged the Council to work towards a compromise, to ensure that Hare Hatch Sheeplands can remain open. Many local residents will be deeply concerned about this.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is disappointing that this announcement has been made on the day after the dissolution of Parliament, when there is no longer an MP for the constituency. If I am re-elected on 7th May, I will be seeking an urgent meeting with the Council to discuss this.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published">17 April 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed a new manifesto commitment by the Conservatives to extend the Right to Buy to the tenants of housing association properties. Over 9,000 families will potentially be able to buy their housing association home in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough &acirc;&#128;&#147; addressing the unfairness that has meant that up to now only council house tenants could buy their home.</p>

	<p>Across England, 1.3 million families will have the chance to buy their housing association home meaning more families being able to achieve their dream of owning their own home. 7,720 housing association tenants in the Royal Borough, and 1,470 in Wokingham Borough, could benefit.</p>

	<p>Homes that are sold will be replaced by new affordable homes. In addition, by requiring councils to sell their expansive council houses as they become vacant &Acirc;&pound;1 billion will be made available to bring derelict, brownfield land back into use for housing.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Everyone who works hard should have the chance to own their own home. Conservatives are committed to extending the Right to Buy to housing association tenants, meaning thousands of families in the local area will have a chance to buy their home. Right to Buy has already helped over 2 million families get on the housing ladder and now a new generation of people will have the same opportunity to own a home.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa: Why this is such an important election for&nbsp;Britain</h1>


<p class="published">28 April 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Ahead of the General Election, Theresa May &ndash; Conservative parliamentary candidate for Maidenhead &ndash; writes about the key issues facing people as they decide who to vote for on 7th May. She says, &ldquo;This is the most important election Britain has faced for many years. Do we build on the last five years and secure our future or throw away the progress we have made?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><strong>Election to decide Britain&rsquo;s future</strong></p>

	<p><em>This is the most important election Britain has faced for many years. Do we build on the last five years and secure our future or throw away the progress we have made? Thanks to the Government&rsquo;s long-term economic plan we are seeing real benefits &ndash; more jobs, low inflation and cheaper mortgage rates. We&rsquo;ve put money into essential public services such as the <span class="caps">NHS</span> and schools and cut taxes for millions of people. Crime has fallen thanks to the hard work of our police. And where we can, we are getting immigration under control unlike the last Labour Government.</em></p>

	<p><em>Good quality local public services are vital. I know personally just how important the <span class="caps">NHS</span> is. As your local MP I have campaigned to support St Mark&rsquo;s in Maidenhead, improvements at Wexham Park and services at the Royal Berks. With more new homes being built I want to make sure there are enough GPs for everyone. Health services are particularly important for older people; this Government has worked hard to ensure older people have a decent standard of living after a lifetime of hard work.</em></p>

	<p><em>Young people need a good start in life. That means making sure there are enough school places, but I&rsquo;m also encouraging business to link with local schools to show young people the opportunities open to them. We can only have good quality public services with a strong economy. This Government has done a lot to cut business red tape and provide the infrastructure on which business depends. I&rsquo;ve campaigned for better train services locally and for Crossrail to go to Reading so Twyford can benefit as well as Maidenhead. I will also continue working for better broadband connections. Faster broadband matters especially for those building a business from home.</em></p>

	<p><em>Our part of Berkshire is a great place to live and we want to keep its character. That&rsquo;s why I have a track record of campaigning against overdevelopment. But we must also make sure there are facilities for local people. Maidenhead Town Centre badly needs revitalising. There are plans underway including the excellent Waterways Development Scheme. This will bring a much needed leisure area to Maidenhead but of course we need the shops as well!</em></p>

	<p><em>One of the things that makes our area great is the many charities and voluntary groups that strive to improve people&rsquo;s lives. I am fortunate to be a Patron of several local charities including Alexander Devine Children&rsquo;s Hospice Service which is providing a children&rsquo;s hospice for east Berkshire and already giving support to families; and <span class="caps">NRAS</span>, a Maidenhead based but nationally recognised charity for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Whether it is longstanding groups like Lions, Rotary, the Talking Newspaper, People to Places and Daisy&rsquo;s Dream or newer groups like the Lily May Page Trust, they are all supported by dedicated volunteers.</em></p>

	<p><em>A huge amount has been achieved over the last five years but there is much still to do. We can only secure Britain&rsquo;s future with a Conservative Government and David Cameron in Downing Street after the election.</em>

<h1 class="article">Theresa urges electrification of the Thames Valley branch&nbsp;lines</h1>


<p class="published">27 May 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed concern following indications that electrification of the Maidenhead to Marlow train line will not be going ahead in the near future. The Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s electrification project will bring faster and more reliable trains along the Great Western line and it had been expected that the Thames Valley branch lines would also benefit. However, a recent report stated that it would not be &acirc;&#128;&#152;technically feasible&acirc;&#128;&#153; for electrification to go ahead on the Marlow branch, raising questions about the future of the Henley branch as well.</p>

	<p>The Department for Transport and Network Rail have consistently said that electrification of the branch lines would go ahead, allowing commuters in areas such as Furze Platt, Cookham and Wargrave to enjoy the benefits of the new electric trains. However, the Department for Transport&acirc;&#128;&#153;s recent response to a consultation on the next Great Western franchise stated that electrification on the Marlow branch could not go ahead before the end of the franchise in March 2019.</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, to express concern and to ask for a clear timetable for electrification to go ahead on both the Marlow and Henley branches.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Electrification will bring benefits to passengers and it is important that commuters on the branch lines don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t miss out. I have consistently supported the electrification of the branch lines and the continuation of through-services from the branches to London Paddington. I am now pressing for a clear timetable for the electrification of both branch lines so local residents have certainty about the services they can expect in the future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published"> 1 June 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local residents to support the Berkshire Disability Appeal, which is raising money to support local people of all ages with physical, mental or learning disabilities. Money raised through the appeal will stay in the local community and go to where it is needed most &acirc;&#128;&#147; funding local charities and community groups doing vital grassroots work, helping to support people living with a disability.</p>

	<p>There are almost 110,000 people living in Berkshire with a long-term health problem or disability that limits their day-to-day activities &ndash; that is about 1 in 8 people.</p>

	<p>Berkshire Community Foundation already funds a wide range of disability charities and community groups across the whole of Berkshire. Through this dedicated appeal it hopes to be able to support many more organisations and improve the lives of thousands more people living with disabilities in Berkshire. </p>

	<p>People can donate to the appeal online at <a href="https://localgiving.com/charity/berkshiredisabilityappeal">www.localgiving.com/BerkshireDisabilityAppeal</a></p>

	<p>Donations by cheque can be sent to Berkshire Community Foundation, 100 Longwater Avenue, Green Park, Reading, RG2 6GP. Cheques should be made payable to &ldquo;Berkshire Community Foundation&rdquo; and clearly marked that the donation is for the Berkshire Disability Appeal.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes more affordable homes for the local&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published">19 June 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed figures showing that new affordable homes for families in the Maidenhead area are being delivered. Since 2010 a total of 800 new affordable homes have been built in the Royal Borough and Wokingham Borough. Across the country over 260,000 new affordable homes have been delivered, with nearly 60,000 homes built last year alone &acirc;&#128;&#147; a rise of 63 per cent on the previous 12 months. This exceeds the targets originally set by the Government.  </p>

	<p>Overall, over 700,000 new homes have been delivered since the end of 2009 with over 125,000 new homes completed and over 140,000 homes started in the 12 months to March 2015. In addition, housing construction orders have almost doubled since 2009. Council house building starts are also now at a 23 year high with nearly twice as many council houses built in the last four years than were built in the period 1997 to 2009.</p>

	<p>The Government is now going further, with work already begun to build another 275,000 affordable homes over the next five years. This will be the fastest level of house building for 20 years. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Every new affordable home that is built means one more family that is able to enjoy security and peace of mind. It is good that hundreds of new affordable homes have been built in the local area. We need to continue to see housing development that is appropriate for the area so more people can enjoy the benefits of home ownership.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes new businesses in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">30 June 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed figures showing that 60 new businesses have been established in Maidenhead as a result of support from Government schemes. The Start-Up Loans and New Enterprise Allowance schemes are supporting people in the Maidenhead area to set up their own business, with recent figures showing that they have helped 60 businesses to start up. As part of this, over &Acirc;&pound;100,000 worth of loans have been provided to help people launch their own business in Maidenhead. </p>

	<p>Across the UK, 30,000 people have now benefitted from the Start-Up Loans scheme &acirc;&#128;&#147; with &Acirc;&pound;155 million lent to help new businesses get going. The New Enterprise Allowance scheme, which launched in 2011, has seen another 70,000 new businesses set up. The scheme is available to jobseekers and those claiming Income Support or Employment and Support Allowance, and gives those with a feasible business idea support from a business mentor to help them develop their plan, and then seed funding if the plan is approved. </p>

	<p>Overall there has a 7% increase in the number of businesses registered in Maidenhead since 2010.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Small businesses are an essential part of our community, bringing jobs and economic security. It is important to support entrepreneurs and those who have the courage to start up their own business. Maidenhead is a great place for enterprise and it is good to see Government schemes helping to make the economic climate even more attractive for people who are creating jobs in our area.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa pays tribute to Sir Nicholas&nbsp;Winton</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 July 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has paid tribute to Maidenhead resident Sir Nicholas Winton, who has died at the age of 106. Sir Nicholas was dubbed the &acirc;&#128;&#156;British Schindler&acirc;&#128;&#157; for his work rescuing hundreds of Jewish children, destined for concentration camps, out of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Sir Nicholas Winton was a hero of the 20th century.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>She continued: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Against the odds, he almost single-handedly rescued hundreds of children, mostly Jewish, from the Nazis &acirc;&#128;&#147; an enduring example of the difference that good people can make even in the darkest of times. Because of his modesty, this astonishing contribution only came to light many years later. So many people owe their lives to Nicholas and it was fitting that, in his later years, he finally received the recognition he deserved. Maidenhead is rightly proud of all that he did, and we must ensure that his legacy lives on by continuing to tackle anti-Semitism and discrimination wherever it arises.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Realising the danger that the imminent Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia posed, Sir Nicholas worked to find British families willing to put up &Acirc;&pound;50 to rescue the children and look after them until they were 17. He arranged trains to take the children out of occupied Czechoslovakia and for foster families to meet them in London. </p>

	<p>He was knighted by the Queen in 2003, and in 2014 was given the Order of the White Lion by the Czech President. A statue of Sir Nicholas was unveiled at Maidenhead Station in 2010.</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa presses BT officials on superfast&nbsp;broadband</h1>


<p class="published"> 7 July 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met senior officials at BT to discuss the progression of superfast broadband in the Maidenhead constituency and throughout Berkshire. Theresa pressed BT for an update on the deployment of superfast broadband and the first phase of the Superfast Berkshire project, following concerns from local people.</p>

	<p>Superfast Berkshire was created in 2011 by the six unitary councils, which includes the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough Council, to improve broadband coverage in areas considered non-commercially viable for the private sector. For the first phase of the project, Superfast Berkshire signed a contract with BT who continue to work in close partnership with the Berkshire councils to deliver superfast broadband throughout the constituency.</p>

	<p>Superfast broadband coverage will extend to over ninety per cent of premises throughout Berkshire by September this year. The next stage of the project aims to extend coverage to ninety five per cent of premises in Berkshire by the end of 2017. </p>

	<p>Theresa questioned BT&acirc;&#128;&#153;s engagement with local authorities and how they will continue to support local residents and businesses once the first phase of the project is complete. BT offered to meet with local residents and parish councils, should they like to discuss any issues.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted with the progression of the first phase of the Superfast Berkshire project, which is nearing completion. This is welcome news for many businesses and local residents who rely on the provision of a good broadband connection. I want to ensure as many areas as possible receive superfast broadband which is why I pressed BT for an update. BT also offered to meet with local residents and parish councils should they like to discuss any issues. I am continuing to press the councils on the next stage of superfast broadband as I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m concerned at the possibility of delay.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May is encouraging local residents to support a fundraising campaign set up by 13 year old Holly George. Holly is a courageous teenager who is looked after by the Alexander&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Care Team from Alexander Devine Children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Hospice Service. She has started a campaign asking people to donate &Acirc;&pound;1 for a virtual hug &acirc;&#128;&#147; 1 Million Hugs For Holly. The aim is to help raise &Acirc;&pound;1 million to build Berkshire&acirc;&#128;&#153;s first children&acirc;&#128;&#153;s hospice.</p>

My friends and I need your help to make this happen.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;You can donate &Acirc;&pound;1 to give me and my friends a hug, we need a million hugs. You can then help by sending my message to every one you know, if I can go viral &acirc;&#128;&#147; and with your help I think I can &acirc;&#128;&#147; we can raise &Acirc;&pound;1m to build our hospice.

<h1 class="article">Over 50,000 people in Maidenhead to benefit from income tax&nbsp;cuts</h1>


<p class="published">21 July 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed further income tax cuts for people in Maidenhead. In the Summer Budget, the Chancellor set out the next steps in his plan to support working people by ensuring they keep more of the money they earn. The personal tax-free allowance will increase by &Acirc;&pound;400 to &Acirc;&pound;11,000, so that next year a typical rate income taxpayer will be &Acirc;&pound;905 better off compared with 2010. Meanwhile, the threshold for the higher rate of tax will increase to &Acirc;&pound;43,000, saving the typical higher rate taxpayer &Acirc;&pound;142 and lifting 130,000 people out of the rate altogether. </p>

	<p>Over 50,000 people in the Maidenhead constituency will benefit from changes to the personal allowance, and over 800 will be taken out of income tax altogether.</p>

	<p>The Budget also introduced a new National Living Wage for over 25s, which will mean two and a half million people get a direct pay rise. Those currently on the minimum wage will see their pay rise by over a third during this Parliament &acirc;&#128;&#147; a cash increase for a full time worker of over &Acirc;&pound;5,000.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This Budget is important in continuing to move Britain towards being a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare economy. The new National Living Wage and the increases in the personal allowance will mean a pay rise for millions of people across the country. It is fantastic that over 50,000 people in Maidenhead are going to benefit from these changes &acirc;&#128;&#147; this means local people keeping more of the money they&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve earned, giving them and their families more financial security for the future.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<p class="published"> 3 September 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead&acirc;&#128;&#153;s decision to approve plans for &acirc;&#128;&#152;The Landing&acirc;&#128;&#153; &acirc;&#128;&#147; a major redevelopment project in Maidenhead town centre. The &Acirc;&pound;230 million scheme will transform the area around Broadway, Queen Street and King Street with new shops, restaurants and housing. The development was approved by the Maidenhead Development Control Panel last night.</p>

	<p>The site, previously known as the King&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Triangle, is a key part of the town centre and has been the focus of several planning proposals over recent years. Approval for &acirc;&#128;&#152;The Landing&acirc;&#128;&#153; should see hundreds of new jobs created, increase commercial activity in the town centre, and encourage more firms to locate in Maidenhead. Development works are likely to be completed in time for the opening of Crossrail in 2019.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is an important step forward for the town centre and is a key part of the wider work going on to ensure a successful future for Maidenhead. We want to see more shops and businesses attracted to the town centre so that it can become a vibrant hub for the community, and so that we can continue to create jobs and support the local economy.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;This decision is a boost for Maidenhead, although it will be important to look at the detailed consent carefully when it comes up to make sure this development fits with the rest of the town centre and the town as a whole.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Theresa May has launched her annual Christmas card competition and is searching for a festive design to be printed on them. The contest is open to children aged 11 and under who live in the Maidenhead constituency. </p>

	<p>The competition, which has been running for more than a decade, will this year have the theme of &acirc;&#128;&#152;What I want for Christmas&acirc;&#128;&#153;. The winning entry will feature on all of Theresa&rsquo;s Christmas cards sent out this year.</p>

	<p>Entries for this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s competition should be marked &acirc;&#128;&#152;Theresa May&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Christmas Card Competition&acirc;&#128;&#153; and sent to the Maidenhead Advertiser, 48 Bell Street, Maidenhead, SL6 1HX.</p>

	<p>The suggested size is A5. Designs need to be bold and bright, preferably using paint, felt tips or crayons as coloured pencils do not reproduce well when printed. Two-dimensional designs are preferred as glitter and cotton wool do not work when printed.</p>

	<p>Entries should also include the name, age and school of the entrant and a daytime contact number for their parent or guardian.</p>

	<p>The closing date for entries is Thursday 12th November. Judging will take place shortly afterwards.</p>

	<p>This year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s prize has been kindly donated by <a href="http://www.longridge.org.uk/">Longridge Activity Centre</a>. The designer of the winning entry will win a birthday party with birthday tea and activity of their choice at Longridge &acirc;&#128;&#147; a fantastic local site offering a variety of water sports and other activities.</p>

She also discussed the future of the Thames Valley branch lines serving Marlow and Henley, highlighting their importance to local residents.</p>

	<p>Among the points raised by Theresa were:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The performance of the Great Western line and the need to reduce <strong>delays and cancellations</strong> caused by infrastructure failure.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The importance of <strong>fast and semi-fast services</strong> from Maidenhead and Twyford and the need for infrastructure improvements to protect these services in the longer term.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The progress of the <strong>electrification</strong> of the Great Western main line.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The future of the <strong>Thames Valley branch lines</strong> including the need for electrification and good connections at Maidenhead and Twyford if through-services to London are removed.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The significance of <strong>Western Rail Access to Heathrow Airport</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The need for better communication with residents affected by <strong>devegetation</strong> works, such as at Sonning Cutting, and more regular maintenance of trees and vegetation along the line.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This was a productive meeting in which I raised a number of issues of vital importance to the future of our train services. I emphasised the necessity of fast services to London being protected and the need for proper thought to be given to the branch lines.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;I also highlighted commuters&acirc;&#128;&#153; frustrations about delays and cancellations on the line and the need for ongoing action to respond quickly to signal failures and other problems when they occur. Network Rail will be in no doubt about the strength of feeling among local residents on these points.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Record low unemployment figures in&nbsp;Maidenhead</h1>


<p class="published">16 November 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing a record low in unemployment in the Maidenhead constituency. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that just 411 people were claiming Jobseeker&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Allowance in Maidenhead &acirc;&#128;&#147; the lowest number ever recorded. The unemployment rate in the constituency is 0.6% &acirc;&#128;&#147; the lowest rate since records began.</p>

	<p>Unemployment has been steadily reducing in the local area since 2010 and the latest figures for October 2015 represent a 76% reduction from the peak in August 2009.</p>

	<p>Nationally, the employment rate has hit a new record high of 73.7% with wages up 3% over the last year. UK unemployment fell by 103,000 between July and September and the unemployment rate is now approaching pre-recession levels. There are now more women in work than ever before, with an increase of almost a million since 2010, and youth unemployment is at its lowest level since early 2006.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Unemployment is continuing to fall in Maidenhead and the local area and it is great that we are now seeing record low figures. This means more people in work with the dignity and security that a job can bring. With unemployment falling and wages rising, we are seeing the benefits of the UK&acirc;&#128;&#153;s economic security. Now we need to work towards full employment and ensure that everyone has a fair chance to get on in life.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes Government announcement of a broadband Universal Service&nbsp;Obligation</h1>


<p class="published">17 November 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement of a Universal Service Obligation (<span class="caps">USO</span>), which will give people the legal right to request broadband speeds of 10Mbps. Plans announced by the Prime Minister will ensure that everybody has the right to request this broadband speed regardless of where they live. It will also place broadband alongside basic utilities such as gas, electricity and water.</p>

	<p>Access to broadband is vital to securing Britain&acirc;&#128;&#153;s place in a digital age. The <span class="caps">USO</span> will act as a buffer and allow households and business to access the speeds they need to work, use important services and entertain families.</p>

	<p>The announcement complements the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s wider work to deliver superfast broadband to 95% of premises by 2017. Over three million homes and businesses have benefited from the roll out of superfast broadband and the Government remains on track to deliver this target.</p>

	<p>Theresa remains committed to ensuring as many properties as possible receive superfast broadband and, for those in Maidenhead who may not yet have access to superfast speeds, the <span class="caps">USO</span> will provide a welcome boost for local connectivity and particularly for rural areas.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that the Government has announced a Universal Service Obligation and, by the end of this Parliament, it will be a legal right for people to access broadband connections. Broadband access is integral for everybody &acirc;&#128;&#147; we live in a digital landscape which is continually changing and broadband is very important for my constituents, businesses and homeowners looking to access important services.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;It is right that broadband is considered equal to basic utilities and I welcome the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s continued commitment to deliver superfast broadband. I will continue to assist my constituents in ensuring superfast broadband is rolled out across Berkshire.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes Ofcom&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mobile Coverage&nbsp;Checker</h1>


<p class="published">27 November 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed Ofcom&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mobile Coverage Checker which will help constituents check the mobile coverage they could expect in Maidenhead and across the UK. Ofcom launched its online Mobile Coverage Checker in August and, using data from the four UK mobile phone network providers &acirc;&#128;&#147; EE, O2, Vodafone and Three &acirc;&#128;&#147; the interactive map presents the estimated level of coverage both indoors and outside. The map displays coverage for voice calls, 3G and 4G data connections. </p>

	<p>In Maidenhead, Ofcom predicts good mobile coverage for voice calls and texts. This is excellent news for many residents and businesses who depend on reliable mobile reception. A colour-coded system categorises each area and Maidenhead &ndash; marked green &ndash; demonstrates the highest likelihood of mobile coverage, with red being the lowest. </p>

	<p>The Government remains committed to ensuring mobile coverage is improved across the UK, particularly areas seen as &acirc;&#128;&#152;not-spots&acirc;&#128;&#153; &acirc;&#128;&#147; areas where there is currently no coverage available &acirc;&#128;&#147; and &acirc;&#128;&#152;partial not-spots&acirc;&#128;&#153; &acirc;&#128;&#147; areas which have poor levels of coverage from mobile operators. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I welcome Ofcom&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mobile Coverage Checker and their prediction of good mobile coverage in Maidenhead for calls and texts. Like broadband, mobile coverage is essential for my constituents and businesses who rely on good reception to access services and work. I encourage my constituents to use the checker and to provide Ofcom with feedback for our area. Feedback is important for Ofcom if they are to improve the maps and develop this tool further. This Government believes good mobile coverage is essential for everyone, no matter where they live.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa highlights need for car parking spaces at Maidenhead and Twyford&nbsp;stations</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 December 2015</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has emphasised the need for sufficient car parking spaces at Maidenhead and Twyford station ahead of the introduction of Crossrail in 2019. Theresa has met the Chief Executive of Crossrail to discuss the progress of the project, and used the meeting to discuss plans for the local area including the need for sufficient parking spaces for commuters. She also reiterated her strong view on the need for fast and semi-fast <span class="caps">GWR</span> services to be protected once Crossrail comes into operation.</p>

	<p>The Chief Executive, Andrew Wolstenholme, presented an update on Crossrail construction including the works underway at Maidenhead Station and the electrification of the train line. Theresa conveyed residents&acirc;&#128;&#153; concerns about car parking at both Maidenhead and Twyford and the need to ensure that the infrastructure can cope with increased demand. Theresa asked for further information about the &acirc;&#128;&#152;urban realm&acirc;&#128;&#153; plans at Maidenhead and said that there was a need for sufficient space to allow people to drop-off and pick-up people from the station.</p>

	<p>There is also a need for increased capacity at Twyford Station car park, where parking is already a problem due to the high demand for places. Theresa has discussed this with <span class="caps">GWR</span>, who are responsible for managing the station, and Wokingham Borough Council, and she is supporting efforts to find a solution to allow capacity to be increased.</p>

	<p>Theresa has asked Crossrail to provide projections of expected passenger numbers so that these issues can be better analysed.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is good news that Crossrail remains on schedule and I am looking forward to it coming to Maidenhead and Twyford. So that we make the most of Crossrail, we must ensure that there is proper planning for the future of Maidenhead and Twyford stations so they can cope with the passenger numbers. I am pleased that Maidenhead station is being improved and I want to make sure that we get the details right.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;At Twyford there is already a need for increased car parking capacity and I am working with <span class="caps">GWR</span> and Wokingham Borough Council to help find a solution. Crossrail will bring benefits to Twyford but it is vital that we have the infrastructure to support it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa seeks assurances on Maidenhead Post&nbsp;Office</h1>


<p class="published">27 January 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May is seeking assurances on the future of local Post Office services, following the news that Maidenhead Post Office had been identified for franchising. Theresa has written to Post Office Ltd to ask for further information about their announcement to ensure that the services people rely on will still be available in the future. </p>

	<p>She has asked for confirmation that there will be safeguards in place to ensure that the current services and facilities will be maintained, including those used by local businesses, regardless of the future set-up of the branch &acirc;&#128;&#147; and that the current opening hours would be maintained in a franchised branch.</p>

	<p>Post Office Ltd confirmed last week that it would be looking for a potential franchising partner for the Maidenhead Crown Post Office, but did not provide specific information on why this was necessary, or what would happen if a franchise partner cannot be found. Theresa has asked for further information on these points so local residents can have greater confidence in the process.</p>

	<p>In the event of a suitable partner being found, any changes to Maidenhead Post Office would be subject to a public consultation.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is important that the Post Office services people rely on are protected, and that local residents and businesses continue to have full access to the facilities they need. I would like more information from the Post Office as to the safeguards that will be in place to protect our services in the long-term if the franchising option goes ahead. At a time when Maidenhead town centre is moving forward, we must not lose an important local service.&acirc;&#128;&#157; </p>

<p class="published">24 February 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the news that Crossrail will be named the Elizabeth Line in honour of Her Majesty The Queen. The line will serve Maidenhead and Twyford from 2019 and provide a through-service from Paddington to central London and Canary Wharf. The announcement was made at a ceremony at Bond Street station, where the Queen was presented with a commemorative Elizabeth roundel.</p>

	<p>Theresa recently met the Chief Executive of Crossrail Ltd to discuss the progress of the project and how it can best work for local residents in Maidenhead and Twyford. It is Europe&acirc;&#128;&#153;s largest infrastructure project. Construction for the new railway is now over 70 per cent complete and is being delivered on time and within budget.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am delighted that this new service will be known as the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen. The Elizabeth Line will be an important addition to the train services on offer in Maidenhead and Twyford, and will be an important part of the South East&acirc;&#128;&#153;s transport infrastructure for generations to come. It is fitting that the line will be named after our longest-serving monarch.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa meets with Flood Re to discuss how scheme will help local&nbsp;people</h1>


<p class="published"> 1 March 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has met the Chairman of Flood Re to discuss how the scheme, which will launch in April, will help those living in flood risk areas to access affordable flood insurance. The roundtable event was held to raise awareness of Flood Re in the Thames Valley and to give local flood activists and the community the opportunity to ask questions about the scheme. </p>

	<p>Flood Re is a world first scheme, designed to reduce home insurance premiums for over 350,000 homes in flood risk areas. Since 2000, flood insurance has been widely available to households at high risk of flooding due to a series of voluntary agreements between the Government and members of the Association of British Insurers (<span class="caps">ABI</span>). These agreements did not cover the affordability of the home insurance provided, however, and so the insurance companies and the Government have been working together to develop a different way of dealing with flood insurance. </p>

	<p>An important part of the Flood Re scheme will be to offer help to people to increase their understanding of their level of flood risk and explaining how, where possible, they can take action to reduce that risk.</p>

	<p>Speaking after the event Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It was useful to meet with Flood Re and hear about how the scheme is set to help local people in the Maidenhead constituency. Some households struggle to access affordable flood insurance and I hope that the situation will improve after Flood Re has launched in April.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

	<p>Mark Hoban, Chairman of Flood Re, commented: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Flood Re will be ready to accept policies from 4 April and we are working hard to ensure that as many insurers as possible are able to offer products. Coming to the Thames Valley is important as we want local people to understand how the scheme can help them access affordable flood insurance. People should speak to their current insurer and shop around to ensure they are able to get the best possible deal for their flood insurance.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">New homes for families in the Maidenhead&nbsp;area</h1>


<p class="published"> 8 March 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed new figures showing housing starts and completions at a seven year high in the UK, with hundreds of new homes being delivered in the Maidenhead area. The latest figures show that, in 2015, there were nearly 1,000 new housing starts in the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough, and over 800 completions. Building more houses means that more people can achieve their dream of buying their own home, and that the next generation will have the homes they need. </p>

	<p>The Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s plans to get Britain building have included reforms to the planning system, fast-tracking house building and investing in schemes like Help to Buy. Further measures include support for small builders, building new affordable Starter Homes for young first-time buyers, and building homes faster with planning permission in principle for brownfield sites. The ambition is for a million new homeowners by 2021. </p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;These figures show that the country is building again and housing starts have nearly doubled since the low point of 2009. More local families now have the chance to buy their own home, with nearly a thousand new housing starts in Maidenhead and the surrounding areas last year. This is important in ensuring that everyone has the chance to fulfil their dream of owning a home.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa welcomes Government proposals for fairer school&nbsp;funding</h1>


<p class="published">11 March 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has welcomed the announcement of historic reforms that will bring an end to the unfairness in the school funding system. The plans unveiled by the Government will introduce a national funding formula to ensure every school will have funding matched to need, to give every child an excellent education. A number of local schools, particularly in Wokingham Borough, have raised concerns about the fact that some areas currently receive proportionately lower funding than other local authorities. Theresa has raised this issue with the Education Secretary in order to highlight the situation locally.</p>

	<p>Under the current system, a school in one part of the country could receive over 50% more than an identical school with exactly the same children, simply because of an accident of history. Under proposals published for consultation, the Government has started the process of introducing a national funding formula from 2017 to 2018. This represents an important move towards a system where school funding is allocated on a consistent national formula. As part of this, local authorities will receive funding to help with their responsibilities towards young people with high-level special educational needs on a fair and formulaic basis, so that no pupil is disadvantaged simply by where they live.</p>

	<p>Providing educational excellence everywhere is a key part of the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s mission to extend opportunity to every child. This includes protecting the core schools budget, which will be over &Acirc;&pound;40 billion next year, including the pupil premium. This is the highest ever level of funding for schools of any government.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am pleased that the Government has listened to the concerns in Wokingham Borough and elsewhere about the need for fairer school funding. The introduction of a national funding formula can ensure that every school receives the funding it needs, with extra funding for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Alongside the Government&acirc;&#128;&#153;s commitment to protect the core schools budget, these reforms will help to end unfairness and make sure every child has the chance to receive a high quality education.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>

<h1 class="article">Theresa discusses car parking during Twyford Station&nbsp;visit</h1>


<p class="published">15 March 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has discussed the need for more car parking spaces at Twyford Station during a visit to the station with <span class="caps">GWR</span> officials. Commuters regularly raise the need for more car parking spaces at the station, and this need could be exacerbated when Crossrail comes into operation. The lack of capacity causes problems in the local area with increased street parking causing congestion and affecting local residents. </p>

	<p>Theresa visited Twyford Station on 11th March and discussed the issue with <span class="caps">GWR</span> Managing Director, Mark Hopwood. She received an update on GWR&acirc;&#128;&#153;s bid for funding from the Department for Transport to expand the car park&acirc;&#128;&#153;s capacity, and on other measures that could help the situation. This follows a recent report by Wokingham Borough Council which highlighted the need for the Council, <span class="caps">GWR</span> and the local community to work together on improving access to the station.</p>

	<p>During her visit, Theresa also welcomed confirmation from <span class="caps">GWR</span> that the station lifts will now operate on a 24-hour basis following a successful trial. This will improve access for disabled passengers and others who rely on the lift.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is important that we have the right infrastructure in place to meet the demand for car parking at Twyford Station, particularly with Crossrail coming in 2019. We need more parking capacity at the station and I welcome the efforts of <span class="caps">GWR</span> and Wokingham Borough Council to seek a solution.

<h1 class="article">Theresa objects to plans to cut Wargrave train&nbsp;services</h1>


<p class="published">10 May 2016</p>


<div class="article-body">
	<p>Theresa May has expressed her concern about proposals to cut train services from Wargrave Station, following confirmation from <span class="caps">GWR</span> that they intended to press ahead with a reduction in off-peak services. This will see off-peak trains serving Wargrave once an hour, in order to allow a faster half-hourly service for Henley and Shiplake passengers.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">GWR</span> have stated that the proposal will benefit the majority of passengers who use the branch line, and that additional services could be provided at Wargrave once the line is electrified in 2019.</p>

	<p>Theresa has written to the Managing Director of <span class="caps">GWR</span> to express her concerns and to ask for further explanation of their justification for this, including the details of how many passengers will be affected. She has also asked for a firm commitment that a half-hourly service will be introduced at Wargrave once the branch line has been electrified, when faster electric trains will be in use.</p>

	<p>Theresa also queried why a formal consultation on the proposal would not be happening &acirc;&#128;&#147; something that <span class="caps">GWR</span> previously promised before any timetable changes went ahead.</p>

	<p>Commenting, Theresa said: &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is very disappointing that <span class="caps">GWR</span> intend to press ahead with cuts to the off-peak services at Wargrave. It is not acceptable for my constituents in Wargrave to be disadvantaged so that passengers in Henley can get a faster service. <span class="caps">GWR</span> need to explain why this won&acirc;&#128;&#153;t be subject to a formal consultation, and, if this goes ahead, they need to provide a firm commitment that half-hourly services will be provided from Wargrave as soon as possible once the line has been electrified.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
